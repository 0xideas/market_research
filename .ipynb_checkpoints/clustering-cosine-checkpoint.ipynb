Her daughter even uses it. I have yet to use mine because I havn't found a tool to get it out of the container yet with out using my hand and ruining the whole jar. Once agian there are no instructions on the container so if your thinking of purchasing this product, here are the instructions. How to Apply Elizavecca Milky Piggy Carbonated Bubble Clay Mask It’s simply to use a carbonated bubble clay mask. While it’s not necessary to wash your face first, you should ensure that you do wash your hands. You can use the mask day or night, it doesn’t matter. You don’t have to wash your face in advance to use the mask, as you’ll be rinsing your face off after you do use it. Many women choose to use the carbonated mask as a makeup remover. However, you can also use it in the last step of your skin cleansing program if you wish. If you wear long-lasting permanent makeup, you may wish to remove your makeup first, as the clay mask may not have enough cleansing power to remove it. The Milky Piggy comes with an included spatula. All you have to do is use the spatula to remove a small amount from the jar. You can use this to scoop out about a half a tablespoon of the clay product. This also keeps the quality pure. You can use the spatula to spread it over your face, or your fingertips. Gently tap it on the skin of your face, avoiding nostrils, eyes, lips, and hairline. You should be aware that the product does foam up so you may wish to place a smaller amount on your face than you would normally for a clay mask. You don’t want to overdo it then have to worry that the clay may drip off. Ensure that it’s evenly spread on your face. You don’t want to leave any large blobs as these may fall off and leave you wasting product. Once the mask has been applied to your face, the carbonation inside the mask will cause it to froth up. It begins to froth up as it oxidizes with the air. This process will take about three to five minutes. You’ll soon see how the gooey wet clay will start bubbling up, and become frothy, foamy bubbles. You’ll notice how the foam has a lighter colour than the actual clay mask product. Many people like to watch this happen in a mirror. You will also experience a gentle tingling feeling on your skin. If you wish to provide additional benefits to your skin you can also use your fingertips to gently massage the clay around your face. You can do this for about one or two minutes. Next, apply some water to your face and continue to massage lightly. This will also help to remove the mask from your face once you’re done. This type of clay mask differs from other types of clay masks in that it doesn’t dry out. Don’t bother waiting, or you’ll be waiting for a long time. After the mask has stopped foaming, or about ten minutes, you’ll now be ready to use a clean damp washcloth to wipe it off your face. Use only lukewarm water. Pat your face dry and you’ll see for yourself how your face is so clean and refreshed! Ideally, you should leave your face free of cosmetics, but if you must apply, wait an hour or two to do so, perhaps in the washroom at work. You should use your clay mask only two or three times a week.\"},\n",

I have combination skin and am looking for a product that will help clean my skin and also control my blackheads. This product was very easy to apply using the small scoop/mini spatula that comes with it. It definitely was entertaining watching the bubbles slowly start to cover my face. The mask was easy to remove. I used a wash cloth and warm water. My skin felt nice afterwards. It was soft, clean and felt refreshing. A few days later I started to notice changes in my skin. I began to break-out which is highly unusual for me. My cheeks became very red, raw and sensitive. The worst however was the dry flakey skin accompanied by what looked like hives on my chin and around my lower lip. They were very itchy and popped up below my lower lip in clusters. I was panicking because I have never gotten such a horrible reaction to any skin care product before. I wanted to make sure that it was indeed this product that caused the reaction on my face so I waited a week before trying it again. I reapplied this mask a week after and I received the exact same reaction as I did the first time. I will not be using this mask anymore and am very disappointed. I really wanted this mask to work well but it was not for me. If you have sensitive combination skin, please save yourself the time, money and embarrassment and DO NOT buy this product.\"},\n",

If you do have sensitive skin I don't recommend you get this since the itching may cause irritation.\",\n",

If the seller/manufacturer could provide instructions in English, this would be perfect.\",\n",

I left it on for 20 minutes per most reviews and while it didn't make my skin feel itchy there was some tightness as the bubbles formed and popped. My skin feels softer and has a glow after use.\",\n",

       " \"For starters, I bought this because I saw a tutorial for it and it looked fun and when I looked for it on Amazon, everyone commented on how it battled their blackheads, which is exactly the skincare product I tirelessly search for with no great success. I was excited to try out my new clay mask and put it on as soon as it came. It bubbles VERY quickly so you have to work fast. It tickles a little, but it's fun! When you wash it off it really is a clay mask under all that fluff. So did it defeat my blackheads? Not exactly. I didn't seem to have the life changing experience with it that everyone else did. However I'm thinking I see a reduction in those blackheads around my nose, but I'm not sure if that's just me convincing myself the mask did something. It does leave your skin soft, but mine was also a little dry so you will want moisturizer afterwards. All in all, I don't know that it's necessarily a magic blackhead eraser, but it sure is fun! I would buy it again just for the bubbles!\",\n",
       " \"Fun fact: the instructions are in Korean. No English translation. Luckily, I have used similar products in the past. Unluckily, I had NO idea it was going to foam and got a little freaked out. That said, my husband and I both tried it and it works really well. We left it on for about 20 minutes and our faces looked and felt great afterwards. It didn't dry out our skin, either. Would buy again...just would like a translation!\",\n",

       " \"Came early, a plus! It's a fun mask to do with people and it helped cleaned my sister's blackheads out a bit. Apparently this product works for all skin types, which I thought it should fine with my skin. I have sensitive, dry skin so after washing it off my face it felt kind of hot and was a bit red. After a while it kind of cooled down a bit but I am still kind of worried. My mom on the other hand was fine, since she has also have sensitive/dry skin. So anyone who has sensitive/dry skin like me, think about it first before getting this product and just do some research. Other than that, the seller and everything is good!\",\n",

Although I love the actual product when I got it and had opened it seemed to have spilled and the inside of the cap and the sides were oozing with the product which I wasn't very pleased about. Other then that I feel this is a good product and will buy it again.\",\n",
       " \"I ordered this on August 11, 2015 and received it on August 15; I was really surprised by how fast I got it since it was a last minute purchase. My sisters and I have been eyeing this product for a while now due to the rave we hear on Youtube and other Korean beauty sites. We all have different skin types: my baby sister is normal-dry, my oldest sister is oily, and my younger sister and I have combination-oily skin. It comes in a cute packaging with a plastic spoon to scoop the products out (so it's very handy for those who like it clean) but I personally prefer using my hands. You have to spread it on somewhat quick otherwise the product will sit on the face and start its process of carbonating. I followed the instructions and began to feel the carbonation working its magic perhaps 1-1/2 minutes in as it warmed up my face. Massaging it after 5 minutes and rinsing it off took longer than I expected--perhaps I put too much product on? But it was quite messy. Aside from that, I would say my skin felt very smooth and cleaned. I don't know if my face brightened at all but I plan to use this more to see the long-term effects. My sisters haven't used it yet but hopefully they like it just as much as I do.\",\n",
       " 'I have extremely dry skin, to the point that I use Aquaphor Aquaphor Advanced Therapy Healing Ointment Skin Protectant 14 Ounce Jar as my daily moisturizer. Not to mention, I live in the second driest city in the US (I drink more water than seems possible in a day). Unless I use Aquaphor, my skin is flaking within hours of a cool shower. Understandably, I am nervous to try new masks, as most all of them are too drying. Not the case with this mask! I exfoliated right before use, and patted my skin dry. Then, I used the spatula provided to swipe the mask over my skin. I wiped the spatula before sticking it back into the mask in order to keep the remaining mask in the jar from foaming. By the time I had finished applying the mask to my face, it had started foaming. The foaming action felt somewhere between a tingling and an itching, but not altogether unpleasant. After 5 minutes had passed, I gently wiped away the mask with a warm washcloth. My skin looked brighter, my pores were smaller (did not remove blackheads, though they were less noticeable), and my skin felt softer. I did start to feel some of the telltale \"tightening\" that us dry-skinned folks are well acquainted with, so I finished with some Jergens Ultra Healing lotion. My skin feels and looks much better, so I am working this into my skin care regimen from here on in!',\n",
       " \"Ok here's a few things. When I got the box it was destroyed but that can be blamed on overseas shipping, however when I opened it there is nothing in English except the title... No directions and you can't read the ingredients... I haven't tried the product yet because I have no idea how to use it properly.\",\n",
       " \"A lot of fun, but I don't feel like it does much else. I received this mask as a gift as I absolutely love trying new face masks. The bubbling effect of this mask is definitely a lot of fun. I don't feel that it cleaned out my pores much or helped with my blackheads, but it did cut down the oil on my face and left it feeling refreshed. The mask is a little difficult to rinse off and you definitely have to watch and make sure you get everything rinsed down the drain. If you have little spots left in your sink that dry, they will take a little scrubbing to get off. Overall I really enjoy this mask and it does leave my face feeling refreshed, but if you have blackhead issues this wouldn't be the mask I would recommend.\",\n",
       " 'I love this. I was so hesitant to buy it because Ive heard its super messy.. but it wasnt. It was VERY bubbley and super FUN. It just kept getting bigger. I cant comment on if it \"helped\" my skin, but my skin did feel soft and clean after using it. I loved it it was worth the price just for how silly it is. And I didn\\'t have trouble washing it off at all. Just, when putting it on, be fast, and close the container because it will bubble up rather quickly. And look up the directions online, the directions on the pkg arent in english.',\n",
       " \"I've only used this mask once, but my impression was that it's effective but just slightly uncomfortable. I don't have particularly sensitive skin (I'm white but don't tend to have strong reactions to most products), but this mask was pretty itchy. Not painfully so, and I had no redness after removing it, but definitely the kind that makes you have to stop yourself from scratching your face. The other issue I had was with removing the mask itself. Maybe I'm missing something, but it was SO hard to get this mask off. Maybe I'm not used to clay masks, but I felt like I really had to keep scraping it off my face. Still going to keep using it because my face felt great afterward, and I'm going to experiment with using less or more of the mask at one time.\",\n",
       " 'Its a fun cleansing mask to try, but I would not buy it again because it is annoying to take off. It definitely is fun to try on and understand the hype that was going on for the IG pictures. But really it is not that different than any other mask. The mask is reasonably priced, but it is hard to store since it will carbonate just in the shelf. Sooooo... I would buy it at least once just for fun if you want it for the IG lol',\n",
       " \"This is fun. I'm not certain that it did anything for my skin. However, if you are having a spa day with friends, then this is perfect. It's so unique and weird that it is sure to be a party favorite. I won't use it in my typical skincare as the tingling sometimes borders on intolerable and I can't wait the time limit to wash it off.\",\n",
       " \"4 out of 5! Tip- spread it on as thin as possible. The thicker you spread it the less it bubbles. Plus if you don't put it on thin you WILL burn your skin. Over all though it was fun, and seemed to tighten my pores and improve my complexion. Only complaint is there is no English directions. Which is ridiculously ridiculous when it can burn your face if you use it wrong. I knocked a star off for that\",\n",

I generally only use it though right before I take a shower, because washing it off can get messy. I really like the smell and the bubbles help your face feel clean. Milky Piggy packs a punch with charcoal powder and the price is great.',\n",
       " 'I have only used this product on a small area of my face and it did not cause any breakouts or redness there and it bubbled up quite well without any irritation. As soon as I do a complete mask I might update this review again, however, for the time being I love it.',\n",
       " 'This face pack comes in a cute lil tub with a little plastic spatula attached. I put it on my face and it starts foaming almost immediately until I can no longer recognise myself and have morphed into a scary/cute cloud. I like to call it my cloud face. When I wash it off, my skin feels squeaky clean- it gets all the oil off-ALL of it- so you definitely need to follow it up with a moisturiser. One must be careful not to directly touch the contents of the tub, as that could set it off and it could start foaming in there. However, if u scoop it out carefully with the clean dry spatula provided, all will be fine. I would definitely repurchase.',\n",
       " \"I really like this mask because I think it's one of the few masks that doesn't take a long time (this mask only needs to be on around 5 minutes). When you put it on, it kinda feels ticklish/itchy for a while, but I think that's because the clay is foaming up. I do sense a difference after using it. However, my face gets a little dry after using this, so I have to put on moisturizer (which is good in general). TIP: Don't put it on your entire face because when it foams it tends to spread everywhere, so you don't want to put too much or it might get into your eyes or mouth.\",\n",
       " \"In love! Work like a charm, kind of hard to put on alone and I'm not sure what this product actually does because everything is in Korean even the instructions. But if you go to the website there is more info. I know after the 1st use my skin felt amazing and you don't need a lot if any moisturizer after, it leaves a silky feeling after and its not drying your skin out!\",\n",
       " \"I received this as a gift, and it's so much fun to use. As the mask foams up, your face looks like it's growing. The foam creates a tickling sensation on the face, but isn't unpleasant. I left off a 5th star for one reason. As others have mentioned, I notice that the mask leaves a film behind on my face after washing it off. My face will feel tacky to the touch. I have to go back in with a face wash to remove the film. Even when followed by a thorough cleaning with a quality facial wash, the film doesn't always feel like it's gone. I'll continue to use the product until I finish it, but I wish it didn't require an extra step.\",\n",

I ordered this mask after watching a video on Facebook and reading multiple reviews. I don't usually get breakouts I was looking for a product that will help get rid of the blackheads along my nose and hoped this would finally be the product to do that. Unfortunately it just didn't work for me. I've been using it for about a month now (every few days) and it does leave my skin feeling very soft but it hasn't done much to improve my skin. It is kind of hard to put on as well because it literally starts bubbling as soon as it touches your skin and then rinsing it off is even worse. Usually I would just take a shower and wash it off in there which made it a little easier. Overall I did like this product but I probably won't buy it again I feel it was the same as a normal face wash.\",\n",
       " 'This product does a pretty good job of getting the dirt out of your pores. The mask tickles while you have it on but your skin feels great after you wash it off. I would recommend this product if you are looking for something a little different than the regular, boring face mask.',\n",

That is until l used a nose strip 3 days after using the mask once. It was full! I always used nose strips and they took out some blackheads but nothing compared to what I took out after I used the mask. I was disgusted and impressed. It even got some where I didn't even think I had them. So it did work for me when I used it in conjunction with a nose strip a couple of days afterwards.\",\n",

The smell isn't my favorite but it isn't awful either. Also, when washing the mask off, it helps to scrub your face like you would if you were using face wash, and even then it still takes a minute to get it all washed off. The instructions aren't in English but it isn't hard to look them up and the application is mainly just common sense. Enjoy!\",\n",

The more you put on the more bubbles and exfoliation occur. I used it sparingly around my nostrils for fear of it tickling too bad. When the 5 minutes were up I sort of rubbed the product into my face and it continued to bubble even after that! I am very impressed with this mask.

I don't know about anyone else, but as the bubbles form, the bubbles cause my face to itch.

Cons: * it's hard to get the face mask on fast enough, it starts to bubble right away! *The tingling sensation of thecarbonation was almost enough to drive me mad! I wanted to itch my face so bad. This is not the face mask to relax with a glass of wine, that's for sure. *i can feel some semi dry patches on my face, so I will make sure to moisturizer well tonight. Pros: *it really does bubble, and that bubbling makes it feel like it is deep cleaning my pores. *its a quick mask, after 5 minutes I rubbed it into my skin for a minute or so, then added water and rubbed more before rinsing off. *my skin feels nice and tight *i always have tiny blackheads under my bottom lip and my nose, this mask really helped clean those out. Overall: *I did like this mask, but I can already tell that it dried my face out, but it did clean my pores out really well. I will use it again, but probably only once a month or less often.\",\n",

Don't apply too close to your eyes or nose, because when the mask begins to bubble up it will block your airway/eyes. Apply quickly as carbonation begins shortly after product comes into contact with skin. Try your best to take out what you need in the beginning and spread that over your face. Once you dip the spoon (it comes with the mask pack) back into the jar the rest of the product will start to bubble up. After 10-20 mins and little to no popping can be heard coming from your face, you know product is ready to be removed.

Easy application - there's a little scoop included that keeps it sanitary, and the product is thick but spreads easily. Interesting experience - it starts off feeling chilly and awesome, but by the time the five minutes are over, my face was absolutely full of carbonated bubbles that got more than just a little tickley... it sounds cute and fun, but it really gets kind of itchy Difficult removal - I washed the mask off in the shower, and that's what I would recommend... the bubbles get wet and reabsorb the mask into the skin, making removal a little strenuous Clean and clear results - my face felt super clean and I didn't experience any post-mask breakouts\",\n",

The clay is VERY thick and a little difficult to wash off but I recommend putting it on before a shower. The directions say to rub it in after about 3 minutes and then let sit some more.

Just a tip though, Don't apply a lot of it on, bc it does bubbling a decent amount. Also don't put too much on your upper lip either.

Still useable tho so not the end of the world. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because the instructions that came with it were in Chinese.

I have extremely dry skin and if you do, too, I wouldn't recommend using it more than once or twice a week as it is rather drying. However, if used with a good moisturizer, it seems to help keep pores clean. The bubbling sensation after the steam is quite relaxing and the mask has a good, clean scent.

As soon as you put it on you start feeling it bubble up and start doing its thing. I left it on for maybe 15 to 20 minutes and the mask expanded/bubbled up to an inch thick, so near the eye area you should be careful to how close you put it on. I feel like I put it to close to my eyes once it expanded when I blinked I would get it on my eye lashes. There are no English directions on the box or the jar so I really wasn't sure how to take it off. I had rubbed a small spot on the side of my face with my finger and it came off easily, but when I rinsed with water it seemed to thicken up and made it a little harder to rinse off.

The ingredients in this mask are no nonsense and non comedogenic. I wouldn't say this mask is super awesome, just because It doesn't have any AHAs/BHAs or anything that necessary helps with acne.

It tingles and tickles during this process, and after ten minutes I washed it off with warm water and a wash cloth. This is a clay mask, so it can be drying and is supposed to pull impurities to the surface of the skin.

Some tips for future buyers : -Don't put too much at once. Apply as thin layer as possible (with your finger, since mini spatula scratched my face once) because it will get airy enough later on. If it's too thick, you'll need more force to wash it off later and damage skin more ! - Once it turns into cloudy texture, put little water to massage in a muddy texture. Then add more water. You'll feel the mud softening. In the end, add a lot of water and turn the mud into foam. It produces A LOT of foam, and I'm even thinking of using it everyday as my foam cleanser. If anything amazing happens after daily use, I'll add more words to my review for sure ! - Right after you're done washing off, apply a thick ! layer of moisturizer and sleep. Next morning, my skin felt so so so smooth. (The container says it has variety of natural oils within, and I wonder if it's true considering such cheap price. I guess I'll just have to trust the manufacturer. )\",\n",

       " \"My 8 year old son was brave enough to try this with me and we had so much fun! Our faces didn't bubble up as big as some of the others but we still got a good amount. Like others have suggested, I believe the amount of foam you get depends on the amount of oil in your skin. My face is on the dry side, but I still get break outs. I was worried that this mask might dry my skin out, like similar masks have, but it didn't. It did help clear up some of the breakout. I've used it around 4 times (once a week) and I still have about half of it left. All around I'm happy and would recommend!\",\n",
       " \"i don't really understand this, and i don't know if it helps, but it's kind of fun. probably won't buy again just because the novelty of it has worn off, but i'd recommend buying it at least once. if you can tell me what this is supposed to help with, i wouldn't mind. i have sensitive skin and it doesn't make me break out so that's a win\",\n",
       " \"I tried this after seeing a review on fb. It looked to good not to try. I am a girl with fairly clear skin, not oily or dry skin with just a few black heads on my nose. I put it on my face and quickly started bubbling. I was surprised how little I needed to use. Waited 5 minutes and rubbed on for 2 additional minutes. Overall my skin felt smoother and clean. As for the blackheads they didn't go away. But, for my first time using it I'm not upset. I'll be trying it again and seeing if results address different.\",\n",
       " \"This is really cool. It definitely bubbles up and foams on your face (almost instantly), and after about 30 seconds you start feeling it bubble and pop on your skin. The mask worked well, and cleared out my daughter's blackheads on her nose. For me, it made the pores on my nose look really small. The bubble-pop foaming effect did feel weird on the skin, but I'll definitely keep using this.\",\n",

       " \"This mask was a fun experience. The tickling of the first mask was a bit overwhelming, but seeing the size it bubbles up to was hilarious. Over time the product lost it's carbonation, the last mask I used hardly fizzed at all but still cleaned my face. However I had owned the product for 3 months at that point and with the container nearly empty I'm pretty sure the mask reacted too the air left sealed in the container\",\n",
       " \"Handy mask, makes your face incredibly soft after use. During use, the mask becomes incredibly bubbly and tickles a bit! It's a goopy mask and a bit awkward to put on. The little spatula that is included is made of plastic and had an extra little piece on it that is scratchy on the face. It's very difficult to rinse off with just water, I have to use a cloth to wipe the mask off and rinse it several times. Would buy again.\",\n",
       " \"This was a fun mask to use. It itched my boyfriend like crazy while he was trying it, but to me it was just a normal feeling mask. Both of us noted that our faces felt clean and smooth after use, but I ended up moisturizing right after because my skin felt a little tight and dry. Other than cleansing, I didn't note that this mask did anything outrageous. Fun to have around and useful for a good gentle cleansing, but I don't know that I would buy a second jar.\",\n",
       " 'Very fun mask, makes face smooth and clears pores. Yet it takes a lot to wash it off, it gets everywhere and is VERY itchy.',\n",
       " \"This product was really fun to use. The carbonation in the clay can tickle or even feel a little itchy because it fizzes up tremendously...but it temporary and my face felt great after the mask was rinsed off. My 4 star rating has nothing to do with the product quality or long-term benefits (as I'm not an expert)...but it's a novel mask that made my face feel nice. I'd buy it again. **Word of warning: Do not get the mask too close to your eyes or nostrils. It foamed up so much, it engulfed my entire face!\",\n",
       " \"I like how it it leaves my skin feeling clear and nice however I didn't give it a 5 star because there are no clear instructions in English on how long I should leave the mask for and it's really hard to clean it from my skin. I've learned I have to use a wet towel with warm water to remove it otherwise it leaves some kind of residue on my skin.\",\n",
       " \"A fun little mask. Works quick. The only complaint is that the bubbling makes my ticklish nose very itchy but this is true of any carbonated mask. Also, the directions aren't in English, but they are on the product page. Other reviewers are correct, you gotta work quick as not only will it be bubbling on where you started by the time you're done, but the mask will start bubbling in the jar itself without the lid. Fun mask! Makes my face feel clean.\",\n",
       " \"I think it does what it's suppose to. Mind you, it's not a dramatic difference and you have to use it regularly to see any difference. I use it once a week and it seems deep clean though it by no means does not leave you flawless. It's somewhat drying so totally use a moisturizer after. It is a clay mask so that's not very surprising. It's somewhat gimmicky but in a good way. I like it and I think it's a fun idea for a mask. It's not that spendy so I might get it again.\",\n",
       " 'This is a cool mask. It gives a tingly sensation after it is applied. It bubbles and foams up as it sits on the skin. It definitely tickles. The bubbles causes it to seep into the pores. It is very difficult to wash off; it is kind of sticky and thick and does not rinse easily. I have to scrub to get it off. I like that it comes with a spatula on top to apply it to the face. Afterwards my face get clean and smooth.',\n",
       " \"Was really happy with this product! Made my skin feel super smooth after taking it off and didn't dry out my sensitive skin. However if you don't like itchy things on your face I wouldn't recommend this for you, it tickles like crazy, but I think most people should be able to handle it. My only issue was when I took the lid off there was a bunch of product kind of dried around the treads and in the lid. It was still sealed! I just happened to get some messy packaging.\",\n",
       " \"I've always admire Korean skincare products, so this definitely caught my eyes. When I placed the order it said it would arrive on so and so date, but afterwards the date changed to 2 days before then which is great. It even arrived a few hours earlier on that day. The package was sealed and new - everything looked good. I used the clay mask that evening and at first didn't really feel a difference, but a few minutes later I felt that my skin seemed softer. Container: You would think the entire container holds the clay but there's about 1/4 in of space from the bottom that does not hold anything. So when you think about it the product is pretty pricey, which is why I would not use it everyday. I would probably use it once every week or so. Product: It has a really nice smell to it, not like clay. I tried it on my hand first just to see if there was an allergic reaction, which of course there was none. It felt really nice when I first put it on because it was cool and smooth. Some people says it tickles their face when it's bubbling, but that's not the case for me. Tips: I would recommend putting the mask on before you shower, so that afterwards you can just wash your face while you're showering. It can get a little messy throughout the entire process. Before openid, get a little dish to hold the amount you want and then IMMEDIATELY close the clay container after you scoop that amount out so it's not exposed to air for a long time while you're trying to put on the mask. Make sure to NOT put too much on your face; a little goes a long way and if you put too much it takes longer to wash the mask off. When you put the mask on you have to do it as quickly as possible because the moment it hits your skin it will start bubbling. Once it starts bubbling it's hard to spread that onto other parts of your face. I also recommend you wash and dry the little spoon/spreader that comes with the package after every use. This is a product to try and it's also pretty funny to see your face surrounded by gray puffs. :)\",\n",
       " \"Love that my skin is crazy soft and makes cleaning out my pores with other products easier, I just wish it wouldn't take like 10 minutes to remove. HEADS UP! Make sure you have a towel and sponge mask removers on hand before doing this. A wet rag works too!\",\n",
       " \"This product made my skin feel hydrated but not heavy. It's the perfect facemask for women with any skin type. Taking it off was easy work even though it was messy. Never has my skin felt any softer and I wish I had some more right now because my face is breaking out. It had a very clean and new aroma and the cutest design! The only reason why I didn't give this product five stars is because you have to put it on too fast and the jar always has a small amount of bubbly product on the inside. PROS: Is not heavy on the skin Will work on any skin types Easy to remove Smells nice and has cute design CONS: Is messy Gets bubbles in product even when sealed\",\n",
       " 'Regardless of what I am about to say, this is worth the money purely for the novelty of it. I mean, it turns you into a bubble monster, and you cant help but giggle. Very cute packaging. Inside is a little spatula to help put the product on your face. It foams up so quickly both on your face and in the jar that i found my fingers did a better job. Its very thick and gooey, almost like partially dried glue. no noticeable smell, bad or good. I found instructions online that said put it on an uncleaned and dry face, leave it on for 5 minutes then wash it off. I left it on for much longer to see how much it would bubble. It bubbled for the full 10 minutes before I couldn\\'t handle the tickling feeling anymore, and it started to block the air getting to my nose (so in the future, I wouldn\\'t put this on my \"mustache\" area). This mask did not irritate my skin, but what did irritate my skin is taking it off. Remember how I said it is very thick? Yea. So it took several minutes of washing off with a textured towel. it bubbled up (soap like bubbles, not carbonated bubbles) as i was washing it off, which combined with the instructions saying to put it on an unwashed face, point this more in the direction of a cleanser. Because of its cleansing properties, I would call this more of a cleanser than a mask, but either way, it worked. Assuming that i got all the thick goo off of my face, I would call this a pretty good cleanser (though i didn\\'t try it over makeup, to see if that would come off). it did clear out some of my finer pores. I felt that it was kind of drying, so i followed up immediately with a heavy duty night time moisturizer. Tips: for easier removal and application, go with a thin layer all over your face. But, for first time users, go for a nice thick layer for maximum bubbles! 4 stars because it literally has the texture of glue, and i am not a fan of jar-style products, due to air exposure, bacteria, and higher likelihood of drying out before you finish using the product. Sadly, this is far too thick to even think about putting it into a dispenser. But, this does not kill the joy!',\n",
       " \"This stuff is awesome! I have only used it once so far but my face already looks and feels cleaner. Obviously didn't get every single blackhead out but I'm sure over time it will. I'll update after using it a few times!\",\n",
       " \"This is a great mask if you just plan to freshen up. I do not recommend this is any deep pore cleansing. The mask starts bubbling in seconds but don't worry about try to be fast, it will continue to work. Even though the instructions state to put it on a dirty face, I would recommend a cleansing before hand because like i stated this doesn't get into pores very well. I have big pores and intentionally made my face very dirty. On a part of my cheek I put the mask without cleansing, on another part I cleaned first, then put the mask on. After the routine of the mask I rinsed it off and my face was noticeably smoother on the side I cleaned FIRST. This is a unique product but I've definitely used better masks.\",\n",
       " \"Super fun mask to use! It smells good and makes your skin feel smooth. If you have dry skin you won't love this because it definitely dries your skin out but if you have oily skin you will love it! The 2 cons for me personally would be that it tingles for sure and it's difficult to wash off... unless I'm somehow doing something wrong...\",\n",
       " \"I'm not too big on face masks, but after seeing all the giggling videos, I had to give it a go. It came with a lovely little stick to apply, which isn't very big, but, one scoop full was enough to cover my whole face. I put it on and INSTANTLY it started to bubble. It feels very interesting, I'm not sure if it's clearing out your pores, but after it bubbled up, I did pat it down and let it dry. It feels very.... Different. There's no way to describe it, but even dry it feels.... slick, like an oil base does, but it's not oily at all. I couldn't take it off at the sink, I needed a shower, and a washcloth. My face does feel very clean, and my skin feels tight. Overall recommend, don't like that you have to almost scrub it off.\",\n",
       " \"I just came back from Asia, where masks are all the rage right now. I brought back a ton of sheet masks, but those get expensive quickly, so I opted for this jar mask, after reading all the good reviews. However, I'm always skeptical of over-the-top glowing reviews (with tons of exclamation points,) especially in the field of skincare, where results are subjective and can vary widely depending on the user. So if you're a fellow skeptic, and you're reading this review, I'll cut to the chase and say that it *does* seem to help pores a little, although I can't say it's any more effective than any other clay mask, used regularly. From my perspective, it absorbs some of the waxy oils (sorry, gross) at the entrance to the pore-- the result is that the gunk becomes very easy to extract, if you are so inclined. Could you accomplish the same thing with literally any other clay mask on a weekly basis? Probably. I don't really think the bubbling is legitimately doing much, aside from being entertaining. The mask has a texture like Jell-O pudding, and is easy to use----smear it on your face, and let it sit for 10 minutes. Once it bubbles up, mush it back down and massage it into your skin like a face wash, then rinse the whole thing off. Skin feels clean and normal afterwards, not dry or squeaky. I read some reviews that made it seem like the bubbles were itchy torture, but they're not. It's a bubble mask, not Guantanamo. It's pleasant, it's reasonably effective, and it's more cost-effective than buying individual bubble sheet masks, so I can see myself repurchasing this when the jar is done. However, I also want to mention that I actually prefer the Elizavecca Kangsi Pack 24K Gold Mask, which does the same thing more or less, but seems to temporarily tighten my pores better. You probably can't go wrong with either one--they both temporarily make your pores less noticeable.\",\n",
       " 'Well at first I was freaking out (my reason for only 4 stars) because when I got the package, some of it had leaked out of the jar and I was afraid the product has ruined. I tried it later that night and it was awesome! It foams up just like all the videos about it, and it leaves my face feeling great and super soft! I definitely advise to make sure you use the applicator that is provided when applying the mask. Using your fingers (easier, I\\'m sure!) would risk ruining the product by bringing the oils and moisture of your skin into the rest of the product, thus activating the \"foaming\" effect. Also, wipe your applicator off before placing back on the lid, for this same reason. Keep lid tight to avoid exposure to excess moisture too! I love using this mask! It\\'s so fun and feels great!',\n",
       " 'I had seen this all over the internet, and I was beginning to take an interest in K-beauty as well, so I went ahead and ordered this mask. Obviously, the carbonation tickles a bit, since there are little bubbles popping up all over your face, but the clay itself is smooth and cooling on your skin. My only issue is that it made my face kind of dry, but that only has to do with my skin type (combination). If you have oily skin, this would probably be the perfect clay mask, but it may be drying if you already have dry skin. I will probably order this again once I run out of product.',\n",
       " \"This is a fun product to use. Would be great for a spa party. Just like the YouTube videos show, the bubbling can have quite the shock factor. This also feels different from other masks. The bubbles make my skin tingle to the point to where I can't decide if I like it or not. I'd read that you need to apply this to damp skin for the biggest bubble effect and that works great. It's a new addition to my skincare routine. Time will tell if it is actually changing my skin.\",\n",
       " \"So I've only used this once, but I am just loving it. After foaming and bubbling in my face for about three minutes, my skin feels baby soft. My only complaint: the fizziness actually tickles! It became a challenge to keep it on my face--ordinarily I'd leave it on the full five minutes, but I just couldn't take it. But the effects are undeniable, and my sensitive skin doesn't feel the least bit irritated. I think this will be a fun thing to do with kids, too. I may have a contest to see who can keep it on her face the longest... The fragrance is very light and inoffensive--important for a product applied to the face.\",\n",
       " \"Love this stuff! I use it as a special treat for my face after a rough skin week (Lots of sun or wind or makeup or sweat or hormones or all of the above.. So basically every week). It leaves my skin feeling soft and happy and soothed, almost like a blank slate to start the new week off on. If you haven't used it, make sure to only leave it on for a couple of minutes (I know.. It says mask. I hear or read mask I think I can leave it on for a while.. You can't with this. At least I couldn't. Made my face raw the first time I used it because I left it on waay to long.) It foams up a lot so you only need a thin layer and it tickles the heck out of your nose. My one gripe is that the smell is a little strong for me. I really wish it was subtler, and even though it goes away as soon as you rinse, it knocks it down a star for me. Also bigger size containers for addicts like me would be awesome!\",\n",
       " \"It came packaged very well, with a spatula attached to the inside cover to help get the product out. Which I love, then you don't have to worry about contaminating the product with any dirt or debris from your hands. I would recommend only applying a thin layer at first until you get the hang of it. I made the mistake of putting some more on when it didn't start to bubble up for awhile, and then when it started to, it was huge on my face. Once it starts to bubble on your skin, it gives a nice tingling sensation. For me personally, I didn't keep it on too long as it started to make my face itch. Once I rinsed it off though, my skin looked so nice. My skin was soft and my pores weren't as big. I'm not sure if I would order again, because I didn't like how it made my face itch. But I'd say its worth trying!\",\n",
       " \"This is a good mask but NOT a relaxing one. The smell is nice, but I can barely stand the mask for fifteen minutes because the bubbles make my face itch like crazy (luckily this seems to be due entirely to the bubbling and not anything to do with ingredient allergies or skin reactions). Definitely try not to sneeze while its on. The foam will spray everywhere. I also had to learn not to get the product too close to my eyes and nostrils. Once it starts foaming, the mask expands (duh); if it's too close to eyes and nostrils... Well, just don't make the same mistake I did and end up wiping it out of your eyelashes or nearly inhaling foam. Overall, I probably won't buy this again because, while its an interesting novelty product and does seem to work reasonably well, it's not what I'm looking for in a mask. This is not the type of mask that you can put on and wear for long periods, ignoring it as you soak in the tub or watch TV or work on the computer. This mask is one that you stoically endure while valiantly resisting the overwhelming urge to scratch your nose.\",\n",
       " \"When you first put this mask you have to be quick! I used the spatula it came with but since it's so small i can only get a bit at a time. Don't leave the jar open for too or the product inside will start reacting. Once the mask is on it tingles and you can feel the bubbles popping on your face. Such a weird sensation but also really cool 😅. After the time spent on your face rub the product in then wash it. It will feel like you put your face through an intense wash. Pat dry your face then tone and immediately put on moisturizer to put back that moisture in your skin since this product can be very drying. The scent is strong but doesn't smell bad. Overall, it's a fun mask you can do with your friends and take a lot of funny snapchat videos 😂.\",\n",
       " \"This was fun. My high school / college aged kids, cousin, husband and I all did this together for the first time while on vacation. It really bubbles up and gets kind of puffy, so that's funny to see what everybody looks like. When I rinsed it off, my face felt wonderful. Very soft and clean. A couple of the other people doing it didn't really like it because I think they didn't like the feel of it bubbling on their face. I thought it was kind of neat and didn't bother me at all. I took one star off because of the people who didn't really care for it and because it doesn't come with instructions in English. You can find instructions (and lots of videos) online of how to use it.\",\n",

I'm not in love with how it feels when wearing I can barely stand it actually because it is like 1000 like tickles in no way painful just tickles like crazy. I almost never take stars of from packaging and things of that manner because I really only care about the goods and if they work but this container annoys me a little. It includes a spatula which in nice but is hard to smooth around nose with small flat stiff spatial which is mine and the majority of peoples biggest problem area. A bendable spatula or just your finger would work better. And the second air lid gets stuck a lot, and is always a mess lol.\",\n",
       " \"First impressions: I received this product today. I was so excited to use it. Unfortunately no English directions are listed, so I came on Amazon. I still had questions, so I went on YouTube. So I started with a dry, clean face and only took out a small amount of product that I was using so I wouldn't expose the rest to air. I actually liked the included spatula, and I think it worked well. It was a unique feeling. After it went on, it did start to bubble quickly, so application should be on the faster side. It tickle/itches almost unbearably, but the sensation only lasts a few minutes. The second bubbling sensation is quite nice, and I really could have sat around all day with it on my face... If my face wasn't purple and I didn't have to go to work today. I had it on about 10 minutes. I did rub it in at the end with my fingers. I'm not sure this did anything but make the removal process a tad easier. It took a long time to rinse off. And it tastes horrible, so heed my warning and avoid your lips during the rinse process. After drying my face I had two thoughts. 1. Hey, good, my skin did not get dyed purple. This kind of was a fleeting worry I had throughout the experience. 2. My skin is so soft. I didn't even need to follow up with moisturizer, which is unheard of in my world. So now it's roughly 20 minutes past mask usage. Skin still feels great, but I'm thinking of putting on some moisturizer at this point. Bottom line: Can't wait to use it again! I'm also going to put it on hubby to giggle as he tickles uncontrollably!!\",\n",

I used the mini scoop that come with the mask to scoop up the clay. don't let any part of your skin touch the rest of the clay inside the container or they will foam up. Only put 4 stars because I need to use more before I decide if they worth the 5th star. Will report back when I finish the container.\",\n",

Also a good one to use on stubborn boyfriends who don't want long excruciating facial routines, lol.

I suggest using warm/hot water to wash off the product, if not, take a hot shower right after to wash off the product. The next day, I have noticed my face is less oily. It feels more hydrated.

After about five minutes (which is how long I read online to keep it on for), I rubbed it in for a about two minutes (again read this online). The mask was a very smooth, thick consistency at this point. I washed it off which took a really long time so you may want to do this before taking a shower.

My face definitely feels better than it did before and it was a lot of fun to put on.

       " 'At first I didn’t put enough on and thought I had received a defective product. I put more on and that’s when it bubbled. Rubbed in and left on for about 10 minutes over all. Didn’t noticed immediate effects and I do have larger pores, but I will say afterwards this product did make it VERY easy to clean existing pores with a blackhead removal tool, so it really does soften your skin up. I have oily/combination skin. Best benefit after one use was definitely easy lite removal with a dermatological tool.',\n",
       " \"Very interesting. It doesn't work as well as the pictures show, unless you put a crazy thick layer. You also have to put it on really quickly because it starts bubbling almost immediately. It was extremely difficult to get off my face with cold water. I would probably recommend warm water. My face is really soft now though and you could feel a tightening of the skin while wearing it.\",\n",

My skin is very soft afterwards. I\\'ve been using this as my fall back mask since it\\'s nice and gentle, and doesn\\'t cost an arm and a leg. I will say, this doesn\\'t get my pores as clean as others but the benefits I mentioned above make it an ok trade off for me. Also my kids get a kick out of my \"puffy\" face.',\n",

I have VERY sensitive skin, and I was afraid that it would irritate it, but I didn't have any problems with the first use. I also have oily skin and I noticed it did take some of the oil out of my skin. Other than how it works on my skin, the product is really fun to use. I honestly bought it because I thought it would be fun, and enjoyed watching videos about it. The bubbles feel amazing on your skin, and feel refreshing. Just an FYI, a little goes a long way, so you don't need to glob a lot on at first. Also a helpful tip, the container has a cardboard like layer under the lid that keeps the product air tight, get the amount of product you want out and then over it back up ASAP. The air activates the carbonization, and it will ruin your jar of unused product if you don't keep it covered. ENJOY!\",\n",

I like the tingly sensation of the carbonation. Once it foams up, I just rubbed it in and let it sit for a while. Clean up is easy. Does come with a small applicator that is helpful. Four stars and not five due to the limited directions.',\n",

Sure, it did bubble and drove me crazy around my nose where I'm ticklish, but I was expecting so much sillier :P I didn't notice a huge different using this mask as compared to others, and after ordering I was afraid most of the hype was because of the bubbles. I still think that's the case, but my skin was softer after. I will update after further uses :)\",\n",
       " \"Very strange mask! I think the appeal is the carbonation as I don't feel that I get any actual benefits from using this mask. I will say the carbonation makes it very difficult to endure keeping the mask on for any length of time. It give you a tickling / itchy feeling that makes it hard to resist touching your face. I've packed it up as a gift for my friend's pre-teen daughter. I thought it might be fun for them to use at a sleep-over party.\",\n",

Well, it definitely succeeded in helping me to reduce my stress! After the 5 minutes was up after applying the mask, I looked in the mirror and cracked up! It is a super fun mask. It tickles your face, and makes it feel tighter after you rinse it off. After a few uses, I haven't noticed a reduction in the size of my pores, but I haven't gotten any new pimples! 4 stars for fun and some success, just wish it would clear out these blackheads and shrink my pores like I thought it would.\",\n",
       " \"Love this product, it was really beneficial to my acne prone skin. However I think packaging needs to be improved because each time you open it and the product is exposed to air- it carbonates, and i found it to be less effective the closer i got to the bottom of the pot. Maybe sell it in a tube? Or in packets? Nonetheless, still love the product- just think that you really only get half your money's worth because of the air exposure (i used this a lot and quickly!).\",\n",
       " 'Very kind to sensitive skin and eyes. I got some right next to my eye and expected immediate burning and watering but no fumes at all. You must be fast when applying because it fizzes up like a Mentos in a coke bottle. I looked like a zombie from Atlanta. This stuff bubbles like soap when I wash it off with a cloth. Altogether a great weekly mask. Im 53 and have oily/combo skin that is extremely sensitive...to the point of absurdity. But luckily no problems so far. I knocked off a star because I found it kind of difficult to wash off, but then I let it dry so maybe that was the problem.',\n",

Also, make sure to keep the scooper clean, otherwise you'll contaminate the rest of the jar full and it will start bubbling inside the container. As to the effectiveness of it as a facial mask, I can't really vouch. I didn't see much of a difference in my skin after using it a few times. It does make my face seem a little tight though, so I make sure to use moisturizer afterword. Use the instructions listed on Amazon because it's all in a different language on the product.\",\n",

You really don't need too much so do over do it like I did or it will really puff up and be hard to see! Once I rinsed it off, my skin felt clean, smooth and a little tighter. Exactly what I needed. The ONLY thing I didn't love about this mask was that it was VERY...earthy smelling. I know that it's the clay but it did bother me ever so slightly.\",\n",

It did make my face feel clean and soft but watching it and showing family and friends how it bubbled friends best part. I got my sister it try it even though she was scared because her face is rather sensitive to most products. She said that she didn't like the way it felt when it bubbled up but she liked how soft her face was and it didn't cause any redness or sensitivity. That was a big win for her.\",\n",

Plus, it's fun :) I like to use it in the shower a couple times a month. In my experience, it takes a while to rinse off, and whenever I try rinsing in the sink I just make a huge mess! It makes my skin feel fresh. I think it claims to clear pores (?) but I'm not sure if it truly accomplishes more than a pleasant sensation. Remember, your mileage may vary! Check the ingredients for anything that might upset your skin. Cheers!\",\n",
       " \"I enjoyed using this bubbly mask. All of the labels and directions were in Chinese. I found that if I left it on for 10 minutes it dried out my skin.

       " \"This is easy and fun to use. It smells nice too. It is best to use sparingly at first because it grows into a foamy glob on your face. My skin feels great after I use it, although it's debatable how much effect I actually see. On the other hand, my 12 year old son used it with me and we could tell a HUGE difference in his skin. He tends to break out in the forehead area and the morning after using Milky Piggy his forehead always looks much clearer. He's normally hesitant to use masks and such, but the foaming action makes this fun to use, even for an almost teenage boy.\",\n",
       " \"This mask was a trip, but so much fun! I got it for a girls weekend of fun and frivolity and everyone loved it!!! It feels so strange but in a good way. It's definitely one of those masks you only use once in a blue moon bc it really cleans the crap out of your pores(to the point that a few of us had some redness the next day) but nothing a bomb a** moisturizer couldn't fix. Would recommend if you've been wanting to try a bubble mask. *** If you have sensitive skin I would highly suggest you pass on this one.\",\n",

It is a fun skin care product, and while I can't attest to it removing blackheads, it did leave my skin smooth and silky after application. I plan on adding this as a mask into my skin care routine. The bubbling is a unique aspect and while unsure of its purpose I did enjoy watching it doing its thing. It is a little tricky to remove as it foams like soap. Overall, a great 'novelty' skin care item\",\n",

This is a fantastic cleanser though! It's IMPOSSIBLE to get off except in the shower, beware! You will scrub for 10 minutes and get it all over your mirror and sink. My ideal results were when i used it in the shower. I washed my face, then put the mask on liberally. Let it sit for as long as you can without spraying water on it, then massage (or sonic cleanse, or both!) it into your skin. If you're using a sonic cleaning device or something that rotates or vibrates, be more gentle than you think you should be. Its very foaming, but a little grainy due to the clay. I saw a reduction in oil with the clay, but you use a lot of it for the price tag. Get it for a fun girls night!\",\n",

All the instructions are in Korean, so there's a bit of guesswork... but it's a facemask, not an organ transplant. I figured it out. This stuff does tickle a heck of a lot while it works, which is also kinda fun. My face was clean afterwards, but not remarkably smooth or moisturized. I'll keep using to see if there is any improvement. Heck, for the price, totally worth making your face look like a science experiment.\",\n",
       " 'More gimmicky than effective. I think my regular clay mask (Aztec Secret mixed with Apple Cider Vinegar is better at deep cleaning my pores.

I will come back and update my review after I use it a few more times and see if there are any improvements after several uses.',\n",
       " \"I loved the mask altogether. The bubbling effect was amusing and I loved the way my skin felt afterwards. I didn't like how careful you have to be to not activate the carbonation with the spatula. If you don't thoroughly wipe the spatula after use before getting more product it will cause the product inside the tub to carbonate. They do warn against that though. Product arrived well packaged in a timely manner and although the box was in another language they did take the time to print instructions in English and place those on the box.\",\n",

The bubbles really tickled my face and even though I don't need the mask on for long, I always felt the need to scratch my face.

As for the product, it is great fun to use - the novelty still hasn't worn off and the pot's almost empty - and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. It's also not one of those masks you have to keep on for hours, which I like. My only complaint is that it's a little hard to wash off, but then it is mud.\",\n",

After 5 mins, rub it in, and then rise. While rubbing in it starts to form more bubbles. I think I applied too much because u only need a thin layer. I love the way my skin feels. Super smooth especially on my nose but it doesn't take out any dry acne scaring the way exfoliating scrubs do. Will definitely use this once a week if my skin needs some baby softness.\",\n",
       " \"I use this only once every 2 weeks or every month since it has strong reactions in the solution and it can dry out your skin if used frequently. Since it does have some ingredients that will dry out your skin a bit, I recommend using moisturizer after, other than that it does the job. Once washing it I use cold water instead and rub off the puffy parts with water. Leave the layer of the mask on me and gently rub it around my face. Do not leave the jar open because it reacts with O2 and will release the energy needed to do the carbonation on your face. Open it, grab what you need and close shut. You don't want to waste what is inside the jar\",\n",
       " \"I really enjoyed this, however, it was hard to keep on since it tickled as it foamed up. It is messy, so I used it right before I showered and washed it off in there. I noticed my skin was soft afterwards and a lot of my blemishes came to the surface the next morning. I had a couple of fresh whiteheads that surfaced so... I wouldn't use this the first time if you have a big date the next day :p The only reason I gave it four stars was because it was messy and I thought I would get a larger container of product for the price.\",\n",

I was really surprised when the mask started foaming almost immediately. I left it on for about 5-8 minutes; the foam was tickling my nose and I couldn't help myself. I recommend using a medium layer--I put it a little to thick on my cheeks and had some trouble rinsing it off. My skin felt so soft--I didn't even have to use a moisturizer after I rinsed. Giving note to all the other users who have large pores like I do--this will enlarge your pores for a bit. Even my boyfriend noticed that mine had distended a bit a few hours after I used it. They shrank back to a normal size by the next morning, but I won't be using this regularly because of that affect.\",\n",

Also, most clay masks smell horrific, but this one has the most pleasant herbal flowery type scent. I only use this mask once a week, but each time it is great.

The bubbles make a pretty thick layer over your face, then you're supposed to rub it into your skin and wash it off! Also doubles as a makeup remover (although I wouldn't put this on my eyes lol)\",\n",
       " \"Initially, I bought it for the bubbles but after using it for a while, I noticed it does make my skin look brighter and I feel my face become a little tighter. I try to use it on my nose often because it's good for minimizing pores. And for ~$10, you definitely get more than 10 uses of this mask compared to the 10 sheet masks for ~$10! The only issue is it's a little hard to take off. What I try to do now is to wash off as much as I can first and then I just scrape off (with my finger, not fingernail) the extra mask that's on my face.\",\n",
       " 'This may be the funniest looking face mask ever! My skin feels awesome too. Pro tip though, once you are done laughing at yourself, get in the shower to rinse off. It is very thick and I made quite the mess getting water all over my bathroom while laughing hysterically at myself, while trying to take this off lol',\n",
       " 'The effects are good! basically the same as any other clay mask. The skin gets very soft. But it was so hard to get it off! I thought it was because I put on too much product but it happened a second time, when I used much less! Also, I couldn`t achieve the quantity of bubbles some of the other users did... maybe I am using the wrong quantity.',\n",
       " \"I really enjoyed this mask and it was fun to do, kind of funny to watch your face transform into a big puffy thing. I wouldn't recommend putting it near your eyes or nostrils as it will really expand and tickle the heck out of your nose or end up in your eyelashes! It smells great, the only thing is it is a bit hard to clean off but its not the end of the world. I've used it on a clean face and an oily face and my face always feels cleaner after using it and I haven't seen any adverse effects like breakouts or irritation.\",\n",
       " 'I love this product and it removes all the dirt from my face. It doesnt dry my skin out like some other products, but I can tell the difference after I use it.',\n",
       " \"Does such a great job at cleaning out and tightening pores. You really notice an effect after rubbing it in after the bubbles are fully formed. Fun to use as well! The bubbles do make your face itch while it's working, however, it's totally worth it.\",\n",
       " \"I ordered this clay mask because of a YouTube video I saw, and I'm honestly really pleased. I really only wanted it because the face mask bubbles, but I was surprised that instead it really does help clean my skin. A few things though that I noticed was I tried this mask on two of my family members and their skin was just too sensitive for the mask. Their faces felt itchy during it. I also found that the mass is drying which is fine if you have oily skin, and since I have a combination it works fine. JUST REMEMBER TO MOISTURIZE. Although I too felt a bit itchy with my first use, I really don't feel it much anymore. Overall this is a really fun but helpful mask, I would advise using it.\",\n",
       " 'Really liked the idea of this mask! When you first put it on, it can be kind of itchy and tickle a little bit. After a few minutes of wearing this, the itchy sensation goes away. The hardest part of this mask was taking it off. Once you add water and massage it into your face, it gets very thick.',\n",
       " \"I love how fun this mask is but it can be super messy. It instantly bubbles up on your face once you apply the mask within 30 second. It doesn't allow you to finish the whole face before it bubbles up. It made my face really soft but I didn't feel like it remove anything in my pores or the black heads. I notice once you start to massage your face after it had bubbles for 5 minutes, it seem like there were a lot of products on my face for such a little amount that I put on. They should redirect to once you massage the face for two minutes, wash it off with a warm cloth instead of hand. It took me 5 plus min to wash the clay off. After I wash my face I notice it was soft but my pores look the same. Overall, it was a fun experience. I'll will definitely give it another try next week.\",\n",
       " \"Fun to use. My friend and I were trying it out and starts bursted out laughing because our faces looked so chubby! Foams up once it touches your face so you have to apply quickly. The smell is not strong, smells like clean soap. You can hear it bubble too. After I took it off, my pimples got noticeably smaller. The only downsides so that when you take the mask off, it is very hard to get off. You'll need to take it off with a towel that you're ok with getting dirty. The other downside is that it is extremely ticklish, especially around the nose area! Other than that, it's a great mask\",\n",
       " \"this mask is absolute magic! I was a bit skeptical about it but after using it I couldnt stop touching my face, my skin was so soft, even my bf loves it! The instructions were not in english so I has to look up tutorials and instructions, pretty easy steps. It tends to dry out the skin so it's better to moisturize after.\",\n",
       " \"I've been wanting to try this product forever! It left my skin smooth and firm but did irritate it in certain spots which the irritation went away over night. I have sensitive skin so it didn't surprise me when it happened. Despite the mild irritation I will definitely use it again.\",\n",
       " \"Fun in a jar. Had a bad day? Put this on and laugh for a bit. As to how it works? Pretty much like any other mask that I've tried. I like that it comes with a small spatula so that you are not contaminating the rest of the mask every time you use it. It smells kinda meh, but who cares?\",\n",
       " 'This is a fun and great product. Was part of a package of \"beauty\" items that I sent my sister for Christmas... sadly they got stolen off the front porch and I had to repurchase them to get her gift to her. Wish we could get shipping insurance!lol and more cops nabbing package thieves',\n",
       " \"Just used this for the first time. It was a lot of fun. It starts to tickle about a minute after you apply. I let it sit for 5, then flushed it off with lukewarm water. My skin feels so soft! It was a little sensitive as I washed off the mask, but that went away quickly. The packaging is adorable and has a place for the little spatula it comes with for application. I feel like this product will last for a long time as I didn't have to use much at all.\",\n",
       " \"I can't really say long term, since I have only used it once. It tickled a TON when it was starting to bubble, and it stung just a little bit, but I have very sensitive skin. It's super hard to rinse off too.\",\n",
       " \"Product works well to exfoliate and clear out my blackheads. But the hardest part is washing this stuff off. After the foam for five mins, rub in some water to exfoliate more, then use 3 gallons of water to get it off your face. I've learned to use the face mask just before it's time to shower so I can just wash in there instead of splashing all over my sink. haha\",\n",
       " 'This stuff really works! I have big pores on my nose and forehead and this mask has helped in cleaning them out and making them smaller in the process. The mask is fun to use and tickles like crazy. The smell is light and the container comes with a paddle to dip out the mask which is really helpful. Leave this stuff on for 5 min, rub in and wash off, your face will feel amazing.',\n",
       " \"I really enjoy this mask. It definitely does SOMETHING to my face. The tingly-ticklish sensation is weird but as soon as you wipe the mask off, your face will feel great. Although, when I was applying it, I wasn't expecting the foam to expand SO much - it almost got in my eyes and could feel it burn a little. Definitely avoid your eye area when applying because the foam expands A LOT.\",\n",
       " 'Pretty basic, clay mask, bubbles up on contact with skin. It smells very strongly like flowery lotion until washed off. My skin got a little sore while using it, but it made it extremely soft and took away the oils as I thought it would. The bubbling is lots of fun, it stands out pretty far when fully bubbled up, and tickles the nose like crazy. Very cool product for a little fun with folks for an at home spa thing though.',\n",
       " \"This stuff was pretty much what I was expecting! I used it as soon as I took it out of the package. And it was very exciting and fun to use. I love how soft and fresh my face felt afterwards, especially my nose! But it does feel like my face is kind of dry now (more than usual) not sure if it's the product or my sensitive skin! I could definitely see myself buying this again and recommending it to others! I do wish the jar was a little bigger, but I learned immediately after applying that a little goes a long way!! Haha.\",\n",
       " 'I love this stuff. I have very sensitive skin but I did not have any bad reactions to this stuff. It did seems to make my skin slightly dry around my chin but I put some moisturizer on and it was fine. It really did make my skin look and feel better after one application. It was fun watching it bubble up. I can see doing this once every 2 weeks.',\n",
       " 'I used it once so I am not sue if it actually did anything for my skin. It did bubble though and made for a great laugh. I will have to use it more to see if it actually helps my skin.',\n",
       " \"Fun to use/ feels good whole bubbling however I didn't notice any actual results on my skin plus it's a bit hard to wash off. It's perfect for days where your skin doesn't need much but you still want to pamper yourself.\",\n",
       " \"I love it! the only problem I and many others have is the directions aren't in English so I treat it just like it's any other face mask I use. Though the product does remove makeup and other toxins, I still rid my face of makeup and oil from the day with warm water and face soap. I found opening your pores with warm water works most effectively for the end result. When applying the mask, apply the product further away from eyes, nose, and mouth because the mask expands more than expected. Leaving the product on for 10-15 minutes once a week leaves my skin feeling fresh and smooth. It's also hilarious to see and feel the mask fizz before your eyes!\",\n",
       " \"I really like this product. I have used it a few times and it really does leave my skin amazingly smooth and soft, plus it's a lot of fun to use. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is so incredibly messy. Definitely best to use this product before a shower.\",\n",

Did not come with an applicator, we used our fingers, and the best advice I can say is to apply it quickly as after a few seconds it will start to foam. Will be buying this again!',\n",
       " \"Super strange, makes me a bit itchy to use, but my face feels good after I rinse. The carbonation tickles a lot, and I recommend not layering too much on, or it'll bubble into your eyes, nose, and mouth. But definitely a cool product.\",\n",
       " \"It was a fun product to use. The directions are all in Korean so I wasn't really sure how long to leave it on but there are alot of beauty bloggers who have tried and said 10 min. I kept it on for 10 minutes and the bubbles were taking over my face, in a good way. Make sure you don't put it too close to the nostrils because it will definitely grow. My face felt smoother after and pores looked smaller.\",\n",
       " \"It foams up pretty quick so you have to apply it fast. It's also kind of hard to wash off. Used it a couple times and my skin feels normal after, not super dry or moisturized. It's fun to use with friends and take pictures of though lol\",\n",
       " \"Awesome product! When you put it on your face its very very cooling and you can literally feel the mask bubbling up on your face. It left my skin really smooth and soft. It did wonders for my blackheads! It didn't completely remove all of them but there was a noticeable difference in the amount. The packaging is cute and has an airtight seal to ensure the mask does not carbonate. I'm giving it four stars since it took was late arriving to my house even though it only shipped from Vegas and I got priority shipping\",\n",
       " 'I would’ve given this 5 stars had it not made my rosacea flare up. It felt really funny on and it bubbles up just as described. My skin was as smooth as a baby’s bottom until the next day when my rosacea became very very angry. Good product though.',\n",
       " 'So far so good! It definitely tingles and the mask definitely starts to bubble up super fast! I saw this everywhere on youtube so I finally decided to try it out! It left my skin so smooth the first time. Not so much around my nose with my black and white heads I have going on there. But I will use this product at least once a week and see the results then. But I like it! Oh and definitely clean the little scoop after each scoop inside the product! It will start bubbling up in there as well! :)',\n",
       " \"I used the whole mask kit before writing a review. However I loved it! This mask is both fun and it does make my skin smoothe. One thing that I didn't like as much is it is really hard to wash off. Showers are better to wash this mask off with. However kudos to the company that made this, it is inventive, delightful, and unique!\",\n",
       " \"this mask feels great! the bubbling doesn't sting and leaves my skin smooth and soft. it is not as strong as other masks i have tried, so do not get this expecting all of your black heads to be removed. it is difficult to wash off. i recommend using this right before you jump into the shower. although it is not the best, it is worth a try if you're looking for a mask that does not dry out your skin.\",\n",
       " \"This was the weirdest mask experience of my life. The bubbles were about an inch tall by the time I got to the final step. No gonna lie, I was slightly petrified for my life at one point. DON'T PUT IT BY YOUR NOSE OR EYES!!! I breathed some into my nose and it started bubbling up; and I almost got my eyes engulfed in bubbles. I found it extremely difficult to get the mask off with water, it started getting super soap like. I probably put too much on or something since the instructions are in korean and I didn't know what I was doing. However, the mask made my skin SO SOFT and clean\",\n",
       " \"This is a good mask! It feels kind of itchy while it's bubbling up on the skin, but that was expected. It's easy to get off and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. If you use this product, make sure to rub in the bubbles before wiping it off to leave your skin felling super moisturized!\",\n",

But for some reason, when the product is on my face the fizzing makes me SO uncomfortably itchy if it's near my nostrils, lips, or eyebrows. Not an allergic reaction since my skin itself doesn't get irritated at all.\",\n",
       " \"This face mask is so strange, but so much fun to use! I love the feeling of my face after I use it! My face feels clean and soft. The only issue I have with this product is that it is sometimes tricky to get off cleanly. It takes a little work to get it all off well. It is fun to watch it foam up on your face as you're waiting for the time to go by. I would probably get this again!\",\n",
       " 'Overall, I like this but I have oily skin with congested pores - especially around my nose. It’s not really a mask, more of a foaming face wash that you are only supposed to leave on for 5 minutes max. Careful though, it can irritate sensitive skin.',\n",
       " \"This item arrived quickly and despite what other reviewers have said, there were English instructions. I did like this product but after putting on, I was only able to leave it on for not even the 3 minutes. I experienced the crazy tingling sensation, especially around my nose, but also some mild burning which wasn't too bad. After rinsing, my face was very smooth and did look great. If you have very sensitive skin though I'd probably steer clear.\",\n",

       " \"So I'm pretty in love with this product. It was fun the first couple times that I used it since the bubbles really make your skin feel strange. The overall feeling is a really clean one, though, especially after you wash it off and put moisturizer on. My skin feels so soft whenever I use it. The only qualm I have about the mask is that it doesn't bubble anymore when I use it, so now it's basically just a normal clay mask that I put on whenever I feel like it. I'm a little disappointed that the 'fun' aspect of the mask is gone, but it's still a pleasure to use and I'd buy it again.\",\n",

Great bubbling results, no sticky residue on face, messy to clean up, and a fun gift.',\n",

I recommend using an almond size scoop because it is a pay to wash off. So I would do this once I was going to take a shower. My pores felt clean, which was nice.

What I recommend is that when you put this on, close the jar right away or it'll bubble up in the jar and it'll be a waste. What I also suggest you do is don't put some around your nostrils or otherwise it'll bubble up and becoming really annoying. It'll become ichy. I gave this 4 stars because I used this for a while now and it doesn't get rid of pores as it says. Well, I guess it takes some dirt away but not a lot. This product does makes your skin really soft so that's good. Great product though, 10/10 would buy again :))\",\n",

I'm not sure if it's because I applied too much product on my face- but when it started to tingle and tickle my face, it was soo annoying. I couldn't stand the feeling. My entire face felt itchy. I normally wouldn't classify my skin as sensitive, but I couldn't handle the tingling sensation on my face. It felt like I had spiders crawling all over. I give the 4 stars because it made my skin softer. I'm going to give it another try, but without as much product.\",\n",

My sister put on a much thicker layer and when the mask bubbled, it looked so horrifying! When it came time to washing the mask off, that was a bit difficult. I had to wash a few times to really get everything off. My sister had a much harder time because she had more on. After washing it off, my face felt nice and soft. However, my sister says the mask is too dehydrating for her. She says her face felt too dry after using the mask. Not sure if it's because she used more of the it than I did. My skin type is normal and my sister's is combination with oily T zone and normal elsewhere. *** Update 2/5/2017 *** One tip to easily get the mask off the face is to wash it off with a face towel. I find this works much better than trying to wash it off with just water.\",\n",

Not only because it fizzles but it does leave your skin feeling clean and oh so smooth~~ The instructions are in korean so let me tell you wsup! - First wash your face nice and clean and pat dry - Second use the applicator to mix the clay mask around a bit - Third Take a generous glob and smear it on your cheeks, chin, forehead, and nose (don't touch the mask in the container with your fingers! it'll cause a reaction and start bubbling) - Fourth Use your fingers or applicator (I like to use my fingers) and evenly distribute the clay mask all over your face and avoid getting into your eyes and near your mouth - Fifth After waiting about 5-10 minutes, pop them fizzing bubbles with your fingers by rubbing it all over your face again - Six Let it sit again for about 5 minutes. - Seventh Wash it off~ It's a little hard to wash it off so you're going to do a bit if rubbing. Note that this mask suds up like soap. - Lastly pat dry That's it! I do this mask about 1 - 2x a week (: Love it!\",\n",

I used it on areas where congested re forehead,nose,chin. It did a great job on me clearing blackheads on my nose. It didn't leave uncomfortable feeling but I used toner and moisturizer after.

Second time I used it what I did was apply a very moisturizing cream with 4 drops of my favorite rosehip oil and by doing that I had no peeling or flaking :-)',\n",

It comes with a plastic applicator which is all that's necessary, there is no need for brush but do what you want.

Once your whole face is fluffy (it does not run) you pat the bubbles down and let it sit a little longer before washing off. Thankfully it does not leave your skin feeling weird or stripped. Pros: -There is a LOT in this little tub. -It comes with a spatula that fits inside the cap. Super sanitary! -It\\'s fun. Honestly. Bubbles on your face? Yes. -Leaves skin clear and feeling lovely Cons: -Long shipping time. :( I wish it was exfoliating as well, but that\\'s personal preference. Overall, it was a great buy and I would buy again.',\n",

Which, btw people, if you use a charcoal/clay product and nothing happens - it isn't the one for you. Now, a reaction is different, but a pimple or two means it's doing its job.

       " 'I have VERY oily skin. After 10 minutes of this on my face, I had less oil but a health glow that I have not seen on my skin in while. Even better my skin felt SOOO soft....I was in awe. I gave it 4 stars because if you regularly use this, for the amount you get, you will run out soon for the amount you get. Awesome product!',\n",
       " \"This mask really makes your skin smooth. I've only used it twice so I'm not sure of the lasting effects but it does thoroughly cleanse your face. It does tickle the whole time it's on because of the bubbling and is also a little messy to clean off. All in all I'm glad I purchased this product.\",\n",
       " \"This is a very fun skincare product! (Make sure to keep closed when not using- WILL FOAM UP IN CONTAINER) My partner and I both decided to give it a go. His skin is not sensitive, my skin is and easily gets irritated. I've used this product multiple times and am happy to report, no skin irritation! I do find the smell something I need to get used to. The first time, the smell was overpowering. I tend to use it once every few weeks (mostly because I'm lazy and have other products I love) and I've grown to mostly enjoy the smell. My partner liked the scent right away. After this is a carbonated mask, it does BUBBLE UP. It goes on kind of goopy and then foams up quite fast, in my opinion. BE CAREFUL of your eyes and nose. Foams up enough to intrude those areas if you put it close by. The feeling of it actually bubbling up is ticklish. My partner barely lasted five minutes before he had to wash it off. I lasted to about ten minutes. FUN THING. You can actually rub it back to a smooth consistency AFTER it foams up... and then it will foam back up. After washing off the mask (which can take a minute or two), my skin felt awesome. It had a nice glow to it and felt so smooth and nice. All in all, fun and awesome product. I even purchased one for a gift for my sister. SHE LOVES IT.\",\n",
       " 'This is a wonderful mask! I have super sensitive skin, and I had no problem using this, however it does tickle, absolutely love.',\n",
       " 'This product tickles a lot, but it is very fun. My skin broke out a little bit the day after I applied the mask, but it may have been due to other factors. I feel like this is a fun mask to use with friends, and I like it a lot.',\n",
       " \"Leaves skin feeling smooth but it's very hard to wash off of your face. Very messy product. It was easier to put it on and then rinse off in the shower.\",\n",
       " 'Apply sparingly! Started foaming almost immediately and after about 15 minutes, I could barely see with the bubbles almost covering my eyes! Smells great and leaves skin silky smooth. I would recommend applying before a shower because it was a bit hard to wash off in the sink.',\n",
       " 'Needs multi language instructions made my pores smaller fun to use makes it tickle and itch for the first few seconds',\n",
       " \"I first heard about this face mask on Facebook, a video of this girl applying it and talking about this product went viral and I decided I had to try it, it looked too fun. For starters, this mask is REALLY fun to apply. It comes out like a think clay (as the label states) and once exposed to oxygen in the air it starts bubbling up so you do have to apply it really fast before it starts bubbling. Once the mask has completely bubbled you massage it a bit more in the skin and then wash it off. Playing with the bubbles was fun cause I'm a dork haha. This product smells really good too so thats another pro. The only reason why I rated it 4 out of 5 starts is because this mask is supposed to do many things but a few are lightening up dark circles and attacking white/black heads. Its supposed to deep clean and get rid of problem areas on the skin. I felt as if my face was super duper clean after I used it but my black heads/ white heads remained the same and ive used this product many times now and still the same result. So it didn't feel that it did did cleaning but did make my face feel soft like a babies bum and clean at the surface. Overall, this product is so unique and cool and I would buy it again.\",\n",
       " 'Fun mask to do! I don’t really see a difference in the quality of my skin after using it but doesn’t irritate my skin either. It is a little sticky and isn’t easy to wash off, though.',\n",
       " 'It was exactly as i saw in videos, made my skin smooth and didnt dry it out. Ive only used it once so i still need more time with it. Only thing I didnt like was how it applied on my face. As i was applying it, some of the bubbled up parts would go back into the jar and activate some parts in the jar. Might be the applicator or maybe how i applied it. But other than that i like it. It was really fun to use and love how it didnt dry out my fave.',\n",
       " 'It works well, but dries out my skin. I use this product every other week. And it really does bubble up!',\n",
       " 'This foams up nicely and makes my skin feel super soft and smooth, but I am not convinced it is helping clean my pores.',\n",
       " 'It’s a fun novelty product, but My nose is actually has more blackheads, and I could hardly see blackheads on my nose prior to using this. The bubbles feel nice though.',\n",
       " \"This mask certainly does bubble - it's fun and easy to apply. After taking it off, my face felt smooth and looked good. The only problem is that it's difficult to remove. It took scrubbing and lots of time to remove. If you don't mind that, it's definitely worth it.\",\n",
       " \"Fun to do! I don't think it works very well, but it was fun & would be great for a facial night!\",\n",
       " 'Noticed a big difference in my pores after I used this. My face felt very clean and dirt definitely had been drawn out. It does leave my face a bit dry after though.',\n",
       " \"I have been looking for a good face mask to get rid of blackheads. This mask doesn't get rid of them completely, but I have seen improvements in my skin. The mask is so fun as it foams up and is quick and easy to apply and wash off.\",\n",
       " \"fun to put on, very difficult to take off. once wet, it acts like very thick clay and returns to the same consistency as it was in the bottle. it takes probably around ten minutes to take off. i don't notice many differences, but it does tighten your skin a bit\",\n",
       " \"Fun if you want to pamper yourself by slapping this on your face while you're watching YouTube clips. Cool to see the clay expand and foam up but doesn't actually lift blackheads. It leaves your skin soft and feeling oil-free, but that's about it.\",\n",
       " \"I purchased this on a recommendation. I really like the way the mask feels when it is bubbling up on your face the bubbles make it feel like it is getting really down in your pores. I did notice that my face looked like it had a nice deep clean when I was finished and was very smooth. The only reason for 4 stars is because I felt like it didn't do much for my face in the way of hydration. It didn't dry my face out at all it just didn't add anything extra either. I will order this again once I am out because I do like the deep clean it provides. When applying the mask be mindful of your nostrils and your eyelashes because the foam grows quite a bit and when I blinked I got some on my eyelashes and it tickles the inside of your nose if you aren't careful.\",\n",
       " \"Very fun face mask! It tightened my skin and made it very clean, But I'm not sure how much it helped my blackheads.\",\n",
       " \"This stuff is so much fun to play with! I did find it to be a bit drying but if you amp up your post routine with a good quality facial oil and moisturizer, it's fine. Definitely leaves your skin silky smooth and is entertaining to watch for 5 minutes.\",\n",
       " \"It's a lot of fun. It's actually the first mask I've ever used, and it's super easy. I just put on enough to put an even layer on my face, then wait about 5-10 minutes (however long I get before the toddler decides he needs to smoosh my face lol), rub the bubbles back into a paste consistency, and wipe it off with a damp rag. It's a pain in the butt to wash off if you just go the water route...it makes it kind of slimy and just move all over the place, without really leaving your face. My face always feels super soft after using it. DON'T FORGET IT'S ON YOUR FACE FOR 20 MINUTES! lol I just did this tonight, and got sucked into my book...and it was a little harder to wash off than normal because it can get a little crusty. Oops!\",\n",
       " \"It's really fun to apply this to your face. As others have said, it carbonates and bubbles up like soda. Remember to close the lid tight and to spread it over your face quickly because it will also start to carbonate in the pan. I've only given 4 stars because after 2 months of using, I haven't noticed a difference in my skin. It doesn't do anything bad, nor does it do anything good that I've been able to notice. After I use it, my face is firm and nice but afterwards not much of a difference. It's definitely the kind of mask you put on with friends, not something with lasting benefits. I would say though if you want to try it, you should give it a try. It really is fun!\",\n",
       " 'This stuff is too hilarious. It bubbles on contact with oil, which means that, as it sits on your face, it tickles you with tons of tiny bubbles. My son (3) thinks it\\'s fantastic. \"What\\'s that on your face?\" he laughs. I laugh too, because it\\'s goofy. In the jar, it\\'s kind of like sticky Silly Putty - it\\'s shiny and goopy. A little goes a long way, and it does come with an internal lid and plastic spatula for scooping some out. I really love that about Asian beauty products - no sticking your fingers right into the jar here, no indeed. It feels a bit sticky going on, and I actually find it a bit stubborn to remove. I prefer to rinse in the shower versus at the sink, because it just takes a little too much water and elbow grease. As part of a three-step pore cleanse, it\\'s been pretty effective for me; no complaints here. The main reason I give four stars rather than five is how hard it is to rinse off. Kind of a downer at the end of a really fun experience.',\n",
       " 'This was a fun product to use. It foamed up so much it was so fun and my skin felt great after.I used this with a few family members and they liked it also very creative skincare.',\n",
       " \"The texture is kind of slimy, which weirded me out at first, but this is a really fun mask. It expanded so much, just be careful of wear you out it so the bubbles don't get in your nose or eyes (I learned the hard way). It did dry my skin out around my nose but I bought the hell pore mask too and use a dab of that afterwords. Totally worth the purchase, I highly recommend it.\",\n",
       " \"It's really a fun mask more than anything cause you end up looking like a big foamy monster. I'm not sure how effective it has been at claening out my pores or reducing oil on my face but it is definitely fun. Don't leave the lid off or get any water in it or it will foam up in the container though.\",\n",
       " \"A very fun product, works very well and leaves my skin feeling so clean and fresh. I don't recommend using it too often as it can be a little drying if over used.\",\n",

       " 'This face mask did everything it said it would! I saw noticeable results (fewer clogged pores, blackheads, smoother skin) after 2 weeks of use every other day. I would recommend this product to anyone suffering from clogged pores and blackheads. Plus its just super fun to use!!',\n",
       " 'I can not stand having it on for more than 3 min it tickles way to much, but it does leave my face super clean and fresh and not dry.',\n",
       " \"Bubbles in seconds! Great mask, leaves my face feeling soft and hydrated. I don't use masks too often but this was fun. I'd use this probably 2-3 times a week. Shipping was quicker than expected and the box was appropriate size to avoid any damage. Even bubblewrap, haha the irony!\",\n",
       " 'It does what it says it would. It feels very relaxing. It leaves my skin very dry but clean. I think it makes me brake out at first but then my skin stays very clear for a very long time so...',\n",

       " 'a very pleasant product which produces a nice \"bubbly\" foam on your skin as it reacts with your skin. Does not feel heavy on your skin as some clay masks does, I therefore love this! Not sure how much results it has given my skin, as I havent seen any big change yet. But having said that, Ive only used it 2-3 times yet.',\n",
