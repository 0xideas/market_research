But those take at least 20 minutes to dry, and I don't always have that kind of time. So I love the fact that this one works more quickly, and I wanted to give it a try. Plus GlamGlow is soooooo expensive (No Zit Sherlock I can usually find at TJ Maxx, but it is a pain to peel off.) Certainly I agree with the other reviewers that this one is fun to use! It's fun to watch it foam up, and don't I look silly right before I rinse it off, and ha-ha-ha! But in my mind, a clay mask is something that needs to get in there and remove the impurities and grease from your skin. I'm not here to have fun, I'm 37 years old and my skin still breaks out, I need some results, people! And although this definitely leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth, I just don't see it getting in there and zapping zits before they develop the way No Zit Sherlock and GlamGlow do. So if your skin is pretty great to begin with, and you're mostly looking for a quick fun home spa experience, I would definitely recommend this product. But if you have some oily greasty acne-prone skin and need RESULTS, I would look elsewhere.",

I had seen a bunch of hype about it, and was so happy to find it on Amazon. I'm going to start with the Cons first, only because it's a short list. Cons: * it's hard to get the face mask on fast enough, it starts to bubble right away! *The tingling sensation of thecarbonation was almost enough to drive me mad! I wanted to itch my face so bad. This is not the face mask to relax with a glass of wine, that's for sure. *i can feel some semi dry patches on my face, so I will make sure to moisturizer well tonight. Pros: *it really does bubble, and that bubbling makes it feel like it is deep cleaning my pores. *its a quick mask, after 5 minutes I rubbed it into my skin for a minute or so, then added water and rubbed more before rinsing off. *my skin feels nice and tight *i always have tiny blackheads under my bottom lip and my nose, this mask really helped clean those out. Overall: *I did like this mask, but I can already tell that it dried my face out, but it did clean my pores out really well. I will use it again, but probably only once a month or less often.",

But it also works so well. I have very acne prone skin, and this mask helps with acne a ton. I like to use this mask after a warm epsom salt bath so that my pores are open. When washing off the mask, you immedietly notice your skin feels so soft and smooth. Its interesting because even though it foams up, you would think its just washing off foam. But it is actually really thick, and suds up a lot when washing off - so it is quite the effort to wash off the mask - but it is worth it. The next day I notice any existing acne is significantly improved. With this mask, a little goes a long way. I have had this mask for 4 months now, and I use it 1-2 times a week, and im only almost halfway through the tub now. You only need about half a teaspoon for your whole face - which equates to one scoop of the little spatula that comes with it. If anyone is wondering, the mask does not fizz up when you open the container, it only begins to fizz once you rub it and agitate it - so I assume introducing air into it by mixing is what \"activates it\". Definietly will be purchasing this many times.",

I thought this would be bad, but I ordered it anywho because the people taking videos of themselves online using this was really tempting. It arrived very quick. I ordered it Sunday night and I just got it this Tuesday. I used it when it came straight to me. Of course with the carbonation in mind, I had to use this very quick. For $11 it is quite a small amount but bubble masks don't generally come cheap anyways. In the box it comes with a spatula to make for easy application/spreading without having to use your hands/fingers. It also has a reusable plastic seal which you should keep using due to the fact it'll probably foam up without it. The texture is really goopy and thick. It's not easy getting it on the spatula with how quick you have to be so it won't start foaming, but I'd imagine with some practice it'll get easier. I took some generous globs onto my face and started smearing it around properly. Do not apply with a very thin layer because if you do the thin layer will start to foam within seconds. From then on after the application, it was just very fun watching my face get all bubbly, I couldn't help but mess around and send pictures to a few pals while I waited to wash it off. It did tickle my face a lot, so if you're someone who doesn't like to be tickled it may be a tad uncomfortable for you. I left the mask on for about 10-20 minutes. Just to see how much it foamed, I stuck a finger through it and it went pretty far down. I used a warm, wet wash cloth to get it off my skin. The bubbles made my skin fairly sudsy and soapy and the grey did not come off my face very easily but I just had to add a bit more pressure to get it off. The cloth also became fairly soapy from it and I had to frequently wring it out. When my face was dry, I was very pleased to notice that the many blackheads on my nose vanished. I also noticed that the red around some acne had disappeared, and some dry patches of skin on my face were moisturized. Even more happily, I'd like to add that with masks I got from the pharmacy, they always seemed to leave my skin shiny/oily-looking, not soft but very uncomfortably smooth, and my skin was also very tight. With this, my skin was not shiny, was both soft and a bit smooth, and my skin was not that tight. Very pleased, and very excited to use once more. I look forward to purchasing again when this jar runs empty!",

Can be tricky because it is not quick to apply it with the little spatula it comes with or your fingers, but if you leave the lid off while you work it will start to bubble up in the container.

It's thick and i think moving at a decent pace will be beneficial with the carbonation process. I only tried this once and didn't get the full foaming look that I've seen but it's because I was trying to record a video and was distracted. It foamed on my forehead which was cool to see the transformation. After washing off the mask, my face was EXTREMELY soft and felt like new skin. It was sooo smooth that I thought I had baby skin. It got rid of all the impurities and I feel like my skin brightened up! Highly recommended!",

I began using 4 Korean skincare products 2.5 weeks before trying out this mask and with favorable results, so I can safely attribute my skin's bad reaction to this product. I cleansed my face and applied the mask as directed; as others have mentioned, you need to work fast as it starts to bubble very quickly. I washed it off after ~5 mins, and did like that my skin and pores appeared clean and tighter. Over the next several days, a cluster of 6-7 painful, red pimples cropped up to the left of my chin and proceeded to camp out for the next week. Only today have I begun to find some relief, following 3 consecutive days of my favorite Benton sheet masks. My skin is normal with a semi oily t-zone, but is not sensitive to many products. I rarely break out except for a pimple or 2 around the same time every month, hence my belief there's something in this mask that my skin simply hates. 2 stars for the packaging and \"fun factor\" with the bubbles. Unfortunately, I definitely will not be using again.",

You don't have to spread too generous of a layer as the clay starts bubbling up almost immediately-- but do make sure to spread evenly and cover up your face-- the product will then enlarge. Your face will get kind of tingly and ticklish as it starts to become a cloud-like substance. You'll look like a piggy haha. I left it on for a good 15 minutes and then removed it from my face. The foam was easy to get off, the clay itself kind of stuck so I had to use facial cleanser to get it off (though water alone is sufficient-- as my partner removed it with purely water). MY FACE FELT RADIANT. It was... SO CLEAN. Though it did not get the little white things out of the pores in my nose, it kind of sucked them out so I was able to easily remove. This is A GREATTTTT PRODUCT for such a great price. Try it! If anything, it is atleast a super fun mask.",

Fortunately, I'm pretty lucky to have very few blemishes, whiteheads, blackheads, etc. but still wanted something to help cleanse and soften my face. This stuff is like thick yoghurt in how it smears and cools. I have mildly sensitive skin (e.g. can't use most facial moisturisers), and this caused no irritation keeping on my face for 7-10 minutes. While letting it set, the experience was rather anti-climactic as one could hear faint popping but could feel really nothing going on. This mask stays relatively moist throughout. Upon wash/\"scrub\" off, it is easy to remove; there is zero abrasiveness; it takes but 30-60 seconds to get off completely. So why 5-stars? My skin has never felt so soft and smooth. I'm not going to equate my face to a baby's arse, but you get the idea. There was no oil left; there was no cracking, as my face is prone; there was no irritation or redness; it was simply and unbelievably soft and smooth. Although I won't suggest this for any level of deep-cleansing, I will recommend it as a once a week use especially if you're trying to impress a bird. There is a very, very mild linger of odour which is rather ambiguous, and won't make anyone think you've used cologne; instead, it has a scented soap linger, which -- if I must say -- is quite enjoyable.",

Once you dip the spoon (it comes with the mask pack) back into the jar the rest of the product will start to bubble up. After 10-20 mins and little to no popping can be heard coming from your face, you know product is ready to be removed. I have found that heating up a damp towel for 1 min in the micro will be the fastest way to remove the mask. Just rinse the rest off with Luke warm water.",

When you first put it on it tingles but in the best way- very similar to the way toner feels. There are no English instructions so just to help: 1) Apply a thin layer to face with spatula. Let it sit for five minutes or until completely bubbled up. 2) Once the mask is completely bubbled up, press the mask down for a deeper clean. 3) Wait for two minutes for the mask to re-bubble, then wash off. The mask should feel like a cleanser. My face does not feel dried out and cleaner than anything. I've tried the clarisonic, every face wash I could find, oils, but this mask changed the game. My face feels soft, exfoliated and cleaner than anything. I highly suggest. I am addicted",

Seemed like a total win. Plus, a BUZZFEED employee liked it and they are infallible, right? Yup, like the Pope. Well, it didn't do any harm, but it did not provide me with any results either. True that the bubbling part felt fun--but I can achieve the same thing with a variety of safe acids and bases, like scrubbing with baking soda + coconut oil, and then adding 1/3 watered down apple cider vinegar. I still had all my blackheads, using a Biore strip afterward didn't help either (I thought maybe the mask \"brought them to the surface\") and same goes for said process in reverse. Turns out this item is non refundable. So Milky Piggy and I will be roommates for a while, until maybe I can pawn her off onto my teenage niece or the tweens I babysit for a \"spa night\"",

Easy application - there's a little scoop included that keeps it sanitary, and the product is thick but spreads easily. Interesting experience - it starts off feeling chilly and awesome, but by the time the five minutes are over, my face was absolutely full of carbonated bubbles that got more than just a little tickley... it sounds cute and fun, but it really gets kind of itchy Difficult removal - I washed the mask off in the shower, and that's what I would recommend... the bubbles get wet and reabsorb the mask into the skin, making removal a little strenuous Clean and clear results - my face felt super clean and I didn't experience any post-mask breakouts",

The clay is VERY thick and a little difficult to wash off but I recommend putting it on before a shower. The directions say to rub it in after about 3 minutes and then let sit some more. This is perfect for the shower because once you rub it in, your hands are covered in a very thick clay/foam substance. It's definitely a fun product and I can see some change in my skin too.

It starts to bubble really fast too like within seconds of applying a thin layer on my face you can see and feel it start to bubble, so you might have to put it on really quick. All of the direction is in Korean so I have to search for the direction online and most of it was apply an even, thin layer on the face and wait five minutes, then \"gently\" massage your face for about two minutes before washing it off. Washing it off is a little difficult as the clay mask is really thick. I have combination skin and really oily around my T-zone, but after using this mask my skin feels soft and tighter after washing it off, so I usually put on some moisturizer. However, I do not find it work on removing my blackheads. After using up the whole product, my blackheads is still present as before. Another problem I find is that when I open up the container, the top layer of the clay mask is alway bubbling, so I am not sure if it is because I let the clay come in contact with the air for long. I take a glob of the clay with the small scooper they give you and quickly close it, but it does not work. I also wash the scooper to prevent any oil or dirt that came from my face to come in contact with the clay mask.",

After using this 3 times a week for a month now, my skin is as soft as my toddler's. My dryness issues have all but cleared up and my pores don't seem as big. It bubbles and almost tickles as it dries. Then, once it is done, you have the option to smooth the bubbly solution on your face for more treatment. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with skin issues. My sister has sensitive skin and uses this when she comes to visit and she loves it. It doesn't leave any redness, just smooth and silky skin. The only downside is that the directions come in Japanese/Chinese and I had to google the directions (and watch the review video again).",

It definitely makes your face itch/tingle as others stated, bearable but irritating to ignore. It is very fast acting so you need to put the lid on as much as possible, the product will bubble in the container and be useless if left off for too long. When you rub the product in after letting it bubble, it feels like a regular clay mask, very thick and slimy. My biggest issue was getting that off my face. My sink was a mess because it required a lot of water and rubbing. I will be using this before a shower because it will be easier to rinse it off in there afterwards. I used it on my 5 year old as well, just on cheeks and chin to avoid any eye contact, and she loved it, except for that tingling. It is very funny but hard to ignore. I'm glad that I tried it but will probably not repurchase when I use it up",

If I could this probably would get a 4.5 instead of a 5, but overall the product was pretty great :) Shipping: I ordered this maybe 2 and a half weeks ago (on standard shipping) and it showed up really early, so for that a 10/10! Very much appreciated, and will be buying this from this company again! :) Instructions: I knew ahead of time that I was going to need translated instructions. Many people said that in other reviews when I did my research. That, I'm totally cool with. The instructions I read told me to have this on my face (dry, so there's no washing before hand) for five minutes. I'm not gonna lie, I went ahead and did ten minutes instead, because I didn't set a timer, and my skin does feel better! So, I'm going to keep doing ten minute intervals instead of five. 9.5/10 (And finally...) Product: For me, I had a lot of fun using this product with my sis! The consistency of the mask is about the same as pudding, and smells like a really earthy hair salon. (which to me smells nice, but some might disagree) On my first go, I had a hard time getting this stuff on even. It starts to bubble pretty quick, so you're gonna need to hurry getting this stuff on! There are two lids, the outer lid, which is for decoration really, and the other to keep the mask air tight. It IS a bit difficult to get this open and perfectly closed without nails! When I went to apply this stuff to my sis, I applied a much more even coat, and it's definitely showing! Her skin is much softer and shines a bit better. The only problem I had here was after I used the mask for my sister, I started seeing the mask foam inside the container, which worries me a bit, hoping it won't effect the overall usefulness of this stuff! Make sure you keep this stuff closed when not using with the inner lid, and make sure it's on TIGHT! Overall 9.6/10! Will be buying again and scaring my family with the foam face (because they all seem to find it scary looking when it foams! \ud83d\ude02)",

If you are at all sensitive to scents or perfumes, DO NOT BUY THIS. I knew upon opening it that I shouldn't use it. I knew as soon as I put it on my face that I shouldn't have. I should have know better than to even buy it, but all the videos and reviews of people having fun with the bubbles were too tempting. I could smell it on my skin after an extremely thorough wash, and washing again hours later. Even my hands were perfumed, hours later. Again, this mask is extremely perfumed.

After 15 minutes, I wash it off in the shower. You do not need cleanser afterwards. This takes off all makeup, dirt, etc. My face feels soo soft. I applied toner just to make sure that all the makeup is removed, and there is nothing on the cotton ball. Unlike other masks, my face is not red after washing it off. Instead, I look like I just got a facial. My skin is oily and clog-prone. This mask does not clog me and really does pull out all the gunk out of your pores. I did not experience any 'purging' after using this mask. I'm definitely very happy with this purchase.",

So, while I can't credit the clear complexion solely to this mask, it's probably a part of it. I use it after doing a green tea steam every Saturday. Then I follow it up with rosehip oil. I have extremely dry skin and if you do, too, I wouldn't recommend using it more than once or twice a week as it is rather drying. However, if used with a good moisturizer, it seems to help keep pores clean. The bubbling sensation after the steam is quite relaxing and the mask has a good, clean scent. The price is reasonable and a little bit of this mask goes quite a ways so I anticipate the jar, while small, will last me quite a while.",

It was very fun to use, and I could honestly see results immediately after. My face felt amazingly soft, I could see my pores were actually cleaned out. Normally my face will feel clean after washing, but within a couple hours its really oily and gross. With this mask, my face felt soft and fresh all through out the following day (did not put on the next day). Was able to wear makeup without it looking cakey or greasy all day. It did not dry my face out either. I reapplied this morning to help maintain the oil production, and my face still feels amazing. I'm amazed with how well this stuff has controlled the access oil without drying my face out. It's been a long time since I have felt this beautiful and confident without having to cover my natural face. Will definitely be buying more!",

I rated 3 stars based on what her take was on it.She wants more and i will order another when this is low. I will say it didnt break her super sensitive skin out thankfully and she swears her face feels very clean after use.If this is what it takes to not only keep her happy, amused and good hygiene than im all for it.Mybe after several months of using twice a week we will see results.",

So far, it's very close to everything I've been looking for in a mask. I'm going to use it again later this week and hopefully for better results. The only reason I give 4 stars right now is because I was expecting my pores to be so clean that they are almost invisible, like the girls in the videos and pictures I've seen. If I can achieve that after a few uses, I will come back and give 5 stars. Changing my review to 5 stars! I used this, for the 2nd time, last night and had even better results. I will go as far as to say that this is the best face mask I've ever used.",

As soon as you put it on you start feeling it bubble up and start doing its thing. I left it on for maybe 15 to 20 minutes and the mask expanded/bubbled up to an inch thick, so near the eye area you should be careful to how close you put it on. I feel like I put it to close to my eyes once it expanded when I blinked I would get it on my eye lashes. There are no English directions on the box or the jar so I really wasn't sure how to take it off. I had rubbed a small spot on the side of my face with my finger and it came off easily, but when I rinsed with water it seemed to thicken up and made it a little harder to rinse off. I really liked the mask I liked that you could really feel it bubble up and work, I do feel you should use a pore clearing peel off mask after (It had brought the dirt to the surface and could see some of my pores were clogged).

I don't have bad skin & I'm only 36 so I don't really know what to expect from products like these. I was hoping it would help with the blackheads on my nose but to be honest I can't tell a difference. My face doesn't feel really dried out after, so that's a plus. Even if I don't know exactly what it's doing, I'll keep using it. The smell isn't offensive or pleasant, it's just kind of \"meh.\" But for a product that sits on your face I think meh is the best.

It has a small ticklish stinging sensation for the 5 minutes that you let it bubble, but I would equate it to a sort of pop rocks for your face. After that, we rubbed it into a mask and let it sit for 2 minutes before washing it off. Be warned, you will most likely need a wash cloth or towel to get this off as it sticks pretty well even with water. It's currently the day after first use and my face still feels pretty soft.

Then when I am in the shower I wait for the clay to soften a little and rub it in my face until it has like a soapy consistency thanks to a little bit of water and use that sort of as a cleanser.

Saw this on a few social media ads and decided to try it out myself. I had to look up directions since it was all in Korean. You don't have to clean your face before you use it. There's a small spatula provided. I didn't want to keep dipping the spatula in the clay after it had touched my dirty face so I kept a damp paper towel and wiped it each time I needed to get more. After applying it...you get to watch your face grow!! It does tingle from the bubbles. After about 10-12 minutes, you pat it all down and massage it into your skin. You wait for another 5 minutes and then you rinse or wash it off! Dry your face and voil\u00e0, you're beautiful again! I gave my husband, my little brother, his girlfriend, my 6 year old son, and my mom the bubble facial and all you heard throughout our house was laughter! And I still have half the jar left...",

I spent the whole time with the mask on popping the bubbles that were almost reaching my eyes. After about 10 minutes I wet my hands and massaged the mask into my skin. While massaging it felt like any other clay mask and felt very soothing. I rinsed it off with warm water and a wash cloth. After I applied my nightly face creams and serums. My skin felt very smooth and clean after using it. This is both a novelty and useful product. My kids liked watching the bubbles grow and I liked the way my skin felt after using it!",

It smells fresh and not even a little chemically and the only downside I can see is that if my face smells like this all the time, I will do nothing but smell my own face forever and lose my job, all my friends and my home, spiralling into a pit of poverty and despair, which brings it down from a solid 12/10 to about an 11.5/10. So, then I took a small amount and put it on the back of my hand and it bubbled, so I don't know but if that's not cute to you, no offense but you're Satan. I'll buy this forever, thanks bye.",

It itches as it cures; which is around 5 minutes. After it has cured rub it in a little more for a couple minutes then rinse off. It takes some effort to rinse it off after which is kind of lame. The ingredients in this mask are no nonsense and non comedogenic. I wouldn't say this mask is super awesome, just because It doesn't have any AHAs/BHAs or anything that necessary helps with acne.

It's fun to let your friends or family try it once just because it is so unusual. All that said, this product really did nothing. In fact I'd say it made my pores look more clogged. I found it difficult to wash off sort of a slimy mud-like consistency. If you're ok with spending the money to try out this unusual mask, go for it, although I will say the people I got to try this with me also told me it did nothing for them. I'm giving it three stars because it is cute packaging, a fun idea, a silly way to make someone giggle or look at you funny (in a mostly good way :)) but no more because of the low level of effectiveness.",

I suggest using a wet rag to help take it off because it's really thick and doesn't wash off easily. My face felt amazing afterwards.

It's still a good mask even when it's not full of bubbles, though. It does a very good job of getting the crud in your pores to come to th surface, but it does this by slightly agitating the skin so your skin could become a little irritated if you leave it on for too long.

I even like when they burn so I know they are getting rid of dead skin cells. I feel like the marketing for this brand is more for a younger crowd thats not into medical grade masks but with the great reviews I thought Id give it a shot. Me and my skin: 35 years old, oily, large pores, occasional acne, discoloration. I tried it a few times. Its cool! I give it that. It has a wow factor. It left my skin feeling clean. That was it. I felt like it was very detergenty. Thats not a word but when I try amd take it off its just so darn bubbly I have to rub and rub and rub and rub! I felt like a drank some fizzy lifting drinks (willy wonka). Any...its just ok!",

It applies as a thick gelatinous dark grey substance and once applied starts to foam up until your face is covered in a pale grey bubbly foam. It looks like a strange mould growth, I kid you not. It tingles and tickles during this process, and after ten minutes I washed it off with warm water and a wash cloth. This is a clay mask, so it can be drying and is supposed to pull impurities to the surface of the skin. Be sure to moisturize properly immediately afterwards and avoid overusing any type of clay mask! Every skin type is different and different seasons and climates should dictate whether your skin needs a clay mask or moisturizing mask.",

I'm not even able to spread it to half my face before its already started to foam and change. 2. While it is fun, I don't really feel it do anything! I don't feel cleaner or tightened or anything. 3. All the instructions are in Korean and while I completely understand that it is a Korean face mask, I was really hoping for some kind of instructions separately in English. I had no idea how to use it and had to look it up to learn what to do. Not a huge deal but a bit of an inconvenience. I won't be buying again but I will happily use the container I have! :)",

My skin has also already improved since i've been using it, my acne seems to be healing, and black heads are disappearing. I also like the fact that I do not have to wash my face before using it, it removes my makeup off of my skin in the process. It's also made up of natural oils, and materials so that is a must for me also. Amazing Product!",

Upon inspection after using this mask I was completely amazed. My face felt cleaner than it has in a very long time. AND my pores looked amazing! I don't remember a time when I felt like my pores looked great before using this mask. I would highly recommend this mask to anyone.

My slight acne was completely red. My face got elevated and bumpy from irritation. BUT My boyfriend who has oily/normal skin is in love with it. He had no problem, no stinging. His face was a bit red, but it didnt come with the pain my experience did. :( I wish there was more information. I get it\u2019s an Asian product, but if it\u2019s popular in other countries, other languages would definitely help.",

Apple an even amount and pretty soon your skin will start to itch like crazy but that's bc it's working .

The very first day, I used it and I have to say that it does not smell bad like some people have said, at least I don't find the odor unpleasant. Anyway, it so fun to use this product because it starts foaming up almost immediately and in the end, you end up looking like you've had an allergic reaction because your face looks as if it has swollen up (with the product on). Like I said, it's very fun/amusing. After rubbing it in, it kind of acts like soap. So, you do not need to wash your face with soap after the product. The end result (even after the first day) is quite nice. It leaves your face feeling smooth and refreshed.",

Wow is all I can say I struggle from horrible blackheads, large pores, and your occasional acne (whiteheads) brake outs this product is a god send I didn't want to believe the hype but just wow, the foam honestly deep cleaned my pores all around my nose and on my chin are not blackhead free but defiantly a whole lot better after just one use!!

If you\u2019re looking for the funny factor, leave it on longer than they recommend and it will get REALLY fluffy. I am only giving it 2 stars bc even when I washed my face after the recommended time, my skin felt greasy. I washed it with my normal cleanser but everytime I use it, the next day my face breaks out.

Everyone was raving about how clean and smooth their face felt after using the mask, so i just had to try it. I had to say, it is a little weird how the product works. If you use too much the mask bubbles up A LOT! It felt a little funny, but after taking the mask of my skin was really clean. The mask did cause little whiteheads to appear the next morning, but i quickly cleaned them up, and there was no blemish afterwards! My face was a little dry after washing off the mask, so i used a night cream over night to prevent break outs. The next morning, I went through my normal routine and went to work, and I actually got comments that I looked more refreshed that day! Love this stuff, I will for sure purchase this mask again.",

Four stars because it really dries out the skin, but it cleans out those pores, so it was worth it. Also four stars because it makes a mess and is harder to wash off the face. Very fun mask. The foaming action tickles, but that means it's working. I used this face mask with my sister and we couldn't look at each other without laughing. I would recommend using this with another person to add to the enjoyment. I plan on looking at their other products and buying more masks.",

It took a few uses for me to realize this. When you apply a thin layer (one spatula full!), it's much less itchy and irritating when it bubbles up, easier to wash off, and in my opinion, more effective. It's a gentle mask that doubles as a cleanser, and it a great one to do with other boyfriend- my boyfriend is also a big fan. I love how quick it is, also, it's a nice boost when my skin is lackluster. When I've used it my skin is exfoliated, soft, and I notice soothed acne in a day or two.

I can't speak for long term use but after using it my skin feels so amazing. It is slightly drying but I followed it up with a light gel moisturizer and it was totally fine. Application was easy and I actually really like the little spatula it comes with but, you do have to work kind of fast because it does start bubbly very quickly and once it starts to bubble it's basically impossible to put more in that spot. Waiting the five minutes is slightly uncomfortable because of the tickling from the bubbles but honestly I was laughing so hard because of how ridiculous it looks all bubbled up that it really didn't bother me. Once you rub it in its just like any other mud mask. When you begin to rinse it off it gets sudsy which is nice but I did have to use a soft washcloth to get it off. Overall it's a really good, fun mask at a good price. Definitely worth a try.",

After 5 minutes I massaged my face and added some water to my hands and massaged too like it says to. it foamed up a little again and then I washed it off with water. One thing I would say I didnt like was that It was so difficult and messy to get it all off in the sink that I ended up hopping in the shower. Do I notice a difference? Actually yes, my face is soft and noticed my pores on my cheeks looked clearer. I gave this 5 stars because i did see a difference in my pores and that's the whole reason I bought it.",

Then I spread it around evenly and jump in my shower. I do make sure my face won't get that wet when I'm washing my hair though. It's such a cute and interesting feeling to feel the clay mask start to bubble up, and I can hear them sizzling! After around 6 mins, I will smear them around my face, rub it in a little and just wash it off in the shower. It takes a little time to wash it off since it's not instantly gone like soap foam. And boom that's it. After that my face is super smooth! I haven't seen any other effect other than it takes my face smooth, and once I didn't put it on my forehead and I can feel a big different in terms of smoothness between my forehead and other parts of the face. It hasn't made me break out at all so that's good! All in all, I think it's fun and cute and makes your face smooth (gets rid of dead skin etc. etc.)",

It sort of felt like someone was popping a sheet of miniature bubble wrap on my face (note: you need to aware that you should not apply this stuff around your nose or eye because it will take you minutes to wipe it away from those areas before preparing for even bigger bubble). The mask had done a wonderful job since it manages to suck the gunk and dirty from my skin and still not be stripping . My skin was smooth, my pores were practically non-existent and even after all that scrubbing (with rough, office paper towels, no less), my face wasn't red or irritated at all.

It has a neutral scent and leaves the skin soft, etc. like other masks.

The only two things that made it a little time consuming were that you have to look up the directions in English( considering it's a Korean product) and also it takes a good 10-15 minutes to wash it off well and doing it the way they tell you too. Instead of massaging my face, I took a rag and took the easy way out of it. Also don't leave the lid open for a long time or else the product will bubble up and dry out to the point where you can't use it anymore, so close the lid after your done applying it to your face. Also another tip is to not apply it too close to your nostrils, eyes and mouth, because it will take over your face! Awesome product totally recomend it to the beauty Grus.",

Some tips for future buyers : -Don't put too much at once. Apply as thin layer as possible (with your finger, since mini spatula scratched my face once) because it will get airy enough later on. If it's too thick, you'll need more force to wash it off later and damage skin more ! - Once it turns into cloudy texture, put little water to massage in a muddy texture. Then add more water. You'll feel the mud softening. In the end, add a lot of water and turn the mud into foam. It produces A LOT of foam, and I'm even thinking of using it everyday as my foam cleanser. If anything amazing happens after daily use, I'll add more words to my review for sure ! - Right after you're done washing off, apply a thick ! layer of moisturizer and sleep. Next morning, my skin felt so so so smooth. (The container says it has variety of natural oils within, and I wonder if it's true considering such cheap price. I guess I'll just have to trust the manufacturer. )",

Quick pros and cons: the tingling sensation is pleasant, it left my face very moisturized, and the little spatula/cap thing is cute and sanitary. I liked using the mask but it's not my favorite. You don't get a ton of product but a little goes a long way (trust me, be skimpy otherwise your eyes and nose will be filled with bubbles lol). There's a mild smell that I didn't enjoy. There are no instructions in English so I just applied it after washing and drying my face and hoped for the best. It's pretty hard to wash off, I highly recommend using a washcloth. And I found the little crackling sound of the bubbles kind of annoying. But overall it was interesting and my face felt pretty good after so I'd say if you've got money to spare give it a shot, but if you're saving up for a go-to mask, there are better ones with better prices.

Within seconds it started to foam up and it felt like little bubbles popping all over my face. After 5 minutes I removed the product and my skin looked great.

The idea of this product is really cool, and is what I am sure lure consumers into purchasing it. Great gimmick, a carbonated face mask. Product is really think and even using a small amount, lots of bubbles are created. This wasn't the problem, the problem is that once it is time to rub in the bubbled up product, the mask is so thick and difficult to rinse off. The lather works up into a TON of soapy bubbles, so expect your hairline to be shampooed. Product dried out my skin, not a fan.",

I have very very sensitive skin and was scared to try it but I'm glad I did! The shipping was fast and packaging was super nice.

The buzzfeed video also mentioned that this is a messy mask which I agree with, it is a little more difficult than most masks to get off. Some reviews said it burned, it does not burn at all, it feels like an itch on your nose that you can't scratch that's all. My skin felt pretty good after using it!

Texture: - Upon application it was a Cold, Gel like consistency. It was funny, kinda felt like I was putting pudding on my face. - After a few minutes it becomes a bubbly foam which you then press and work into your skin - Once you've pressed it in, you notice that it's now more of a muddy consistency. - Here comes the difficulty, washing it off took some time. I suggest wiping it off with a towel first and then washing the remainder Thoughts: It bubbled up before I was able to apply it to my entire face so I feel as though you have to work pretty quickly. I mean it was fun to take pictures and stuff. Safe for sensitive skin I suppose because I tried it on my daughter who also enjoyed playing with it. Results: - Face felt clean. Like bar soap squeaky clean. However, I feel like the same thing could be achieved with a good cleanser or bar soap. Didn't do much for my black heads and stuff. I mean, it got the makeup off but man oh man it was so much work. A bit pricey for the product and I wouldn't buy it again. It definitely isn't a go to mask or holy grail, but if you're looking for something fun lol.",

You have to be kind of quick when applying it if you want to get your face evenly coated before it starts bubbling up, but the slight tingly sensation is nice and cooling, and your face feels soft and refreshed afterwards. I will say it took more muscle to remove than I would've initially guessed, but since you are putting clay goop on your face, I suppose it makes sense. I still have to wash, wash, double check, then wash more because there are always a handful of spots you didn't get washed off completely the first few minutes of rinsing. Like others, I watched a few youtubes for instructions first, and don't be mislead by people saying how messy this stuff is. I have had zero problems with it making a mess, and it won't \"get everywhere\" as long as you're not a mini-spatula-wielding maniac. I will say that it does expand once it bubbles up, so yea, if you put it too close to your nostrils initially, you will probably get some up your nose once it has puffed up. The kids are young and still have perfect skin, and I can't say that I have skin problematic enough to say that this \"helped\" in any long term way, but it's still a fun pampering activity, and your face will definitely feel and smell wonderful after.",

When done your face itself looks like a huge bubble, it's quite fascinating. I kept the mask on for 10 minutes. Afterwards I used wet hands to rub the product in, then I washed with warm water.

After one use of this stuff, my face was brighter, smoother and felt soooo clean! Got rid of my blackheads especially on my nose! I love this smell of this stuff too. It does bubble up like crazy so I only use a walnut size. Also, when you apply this make sure you close the lid right away so you don't waste the product because it will bubble up if you leave it open. What I do is after I let the bubbles sit for 5 mins, I rub it in and it turns into a clay mask, then after that I wait 15 min and wash it off, that's how I notice the best results. My best friend has bad acne and sensitive skin and she loves it! One day I thought she had foundation on but she told me it was just her face! Huge improvement, I highly recommend this stuff!!!!",

After that, if you leave the mask on longer, your face feels hard. The cleaning process is also a pain. I don't understand how other people washed it off so easily, but when I try to wash it with water, the mask turns into a soap and makes my face all sudsy. It also gets into my hair. The solution I had to this was using the mask before showering so it's easier to wash off in the shower. As for the effects on my skin (I have combination-oily), my face felt clean after I used it but I didn't experience any long term effects. Overall, I would recommend this product only if you want to experience the bubbling effect lol. It wasn't really worth it to me since I was looking for an effective mask with different needs. This was more of a spur of the moment purchase but it was fun haha.",

It has helped minimize my pores and has eliminated any blackheads - plus has made my skin smooth; however, I still follow up with a moisturizer. The mask is a little bit messy when removing, so I recommend putting it on just before a shower. Also, when you're finished taking the clay out of the container, but the lid back on asap. It will start to bubble if you leave it open and exposed to air. Another amazing thing - it arrive a month early! Don't let the shipping date fool you :-) I will be purchasing this item again.

I feel like this mask does a good job of cleaning out my pores. However it's also a bit of a nuisance to use. I find it hard to spread the mask evenly with the paddle and it also always gets into my hair every time! Even if I don't put it very close to my hairline, it either happens as I'm applying or when I'm washing the mask off since it foams up into a fairly thick lather. I have a lot of fine wispy hairs around my hairline, so maybe this is not a problem for everyone, but it is definitely a hassle for me.

I purchased it right away and it came rather quickly. I opened the product and followed the directions and I was amazed. The carbonated bubbles started working extremely quickly. The bubbles did make my face itch while they were working on my skin. By experiencing that effect I knew this product was doing something. I then massaged it in some more to get whatever other dirt and oil was on my skin to loosen up then I proceeded to wash off my face with warm water. This product is a little hard to wash off, but not impossible. I love this product and I'm glad I saw the review because I have never seen or heard of this carbonated bubble face mask before. I'm glad I purchased it. I would definitely recommend this bubble mask to anyone who would like a fun experience and a cleaner face. This mask did not get every single one of the black heads out, but it did do it's intended job and I'm pleased with the results.",

The carbonation feels almost like you're being lightly tickled and it's entertaining to listen to the tiny bubbles pop. It comes with a spatula to apply so a mask brush is unnecessary. The mixture itself is pretty thick and some carbonation in between uses is expected after contact with the spatula. After massaging and washing off, the mask brightens skin, moisturizes, and refreshes. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to get into Korean beauty products, especially as a first non-sheet mask!",

            "review_text": "I've always admire Korean skincare products, so this definitely caught my eyes. When I placed the order it said it would arrive on so and so date, but afterwards the date changed to 2 days before then which is great. It even arrived a few hours earlier on that day. The package was sealed and new - everything looked good. I used the clay mask that evening and at first didn't really feel a difference, but a few minutes later I felt that my skin seemed softer. Container: You would think the entire container holds the clay but there's about 1/4 in of space from the bottom that does not hold anything. So when you think about it the product is pretty pricey, which is why I would not use it everyday. I would probably use it once every week or so. Product: It has a really nice smell to it, not like clay. I tried it on my hand first just to see if there was an allergic reaction, which of course there was none. It felt really nice when I first put it on because it was cool and smooth. Some people says it tickles their face when it's bubbling, but that's not the case for me. Tips: I would recommend putting the mask on before you shower, so that afterwards you can just wash your face while you're showering. It can get a little messy throughout the entire process. Before openid, get a little dish to hold the amount you want and then IMMEDIATELY close the clay container after you scoop that amount out so it's not exposed to air for a long time while you're trying to put on the mask. Make sure to NOT put too much on your face; a little goes a long way and if you put too much it takes longer to wash the mask off. When you put the mask on you have to do it as quickly as possible because the moment it hits your skin it will start bubbling. Once it starts bubbling it's hard to spread that onto other parts of your face. I also recommend you wash and dry the little spoon/spreader that comes with the package after every use. This is a product to try and it's also pretty funny to see your face surrounded by gray puffs. :)",

My daughter typically uses brands that cater to sensitive skin and thought this mask would work well for her skin. Almost immediately after applying the product for the first time she had a severe skin reaction resulting in bright red skin, forehead and cheeks. Within 2 hours she had small red bumps appear. It took 18hrs for the redness and bumps to subside. Unfortunately we do not know what ingredient causes problems but if you have sensitive skin, I would recommend staying away from this product.",

It was incredibly hard to wash off because it kept foaming up and my face still burns hours after. My face is now red and dry, and I do not have sensitive skin.

Never has my skin felt any softer and I wish I had some more right now because my face is breaking out. It had a very clean and new aroma and the cutest design! The only reason why I didn't give this product five stars is because you have to put it on too fast and the jar always has a small amount of bubbly product on the inside. PROS: Is not heavy on the skin Will work on any skin types Easy to remove Smells nice and has cute design CONS: Is messy Gets bubbles in product even when sealed",
