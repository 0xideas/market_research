The mask is also extremely soapy and hard to wash off, it reminded me of washing laundry detergent off your hands. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if that was precisely how they made it foam - by adding laundry detergent. I suggest you read up on skincare (reputable, scientifically supported sites like beautypedia.com) and stay away from products like these.",

However, all you have to do is Google the product or check Pinterest for the How To. You apply it evenly to an unwashed, dry face. Let sit for 5 mins or until all over bubbles (you'll hear and feel them). Rub in for 1-2 mins, then wash off. Pat face dry. Apply toner/moisturizer or make up as normal, or go fresh faced!

To my surprise, it arrived on my doorstep sooner than I expected. I rushed home and couldn't wait to get it out of the box and onto my face. It has a unique smell to it. . Don't leave the cover off for too long or it will start to bubble itself. I tried to use the little spatula that it came with, but I'm a hands/fingers type of person. Needless to say, the spatula is still sitting on the cover and it hasn't come off since. You must be quick to apply it because it starts foaming immediately. Don't apply too much around your nose and eyes, it will foam up and you wont be able to breathe or see. LoL. Washed my face and O.M.G. My skin never looked so nice or felt so smooth.

I was excited to try out my new clay mask and put it on as soon as it came. It bubbles VERY quickly so you have to work fast. It tickles a little, but it's fun! When you wash it off it really is a clay mask under all that fluff. So did it defeat my blackheads? Not exactly. I didn't seem to have the life changing experience with it that everyone else did. However I'm thinking I see a reduction in those blackheads around my nose, but I'm not sure if that's just me convincing myself the mask did something. It does leave your skin soft, but mine was also a little dry so you will want moisturizer afterwards. All in all, I don't know that it's necessarily a magic blackhead eraser, but it sure is fun!

I have oily/sensitive skin so after drying off my face i put some toner and my face feels warm, reddish and its still itchy. I guess I am that sensitive. I dont know how I should feel about this product, it seemed to be working but ghe itchness and redness is a no-no for me.

I have struggled with horrible acne since I was 13 (I'm 20 now) and this mask was a dream come true. HOW I USE IT: I usually use the mask 2-3 times a week. I put it on before I take a shower. I get a small amount (a little goes a long way here) and rub it all over my face. WAIT 5 MINs! That ALL it takes AMAZING!! After five mins wet your fingers and gently rub your face till the mask feels creamy everywhere. Then get in the shower and wash it off first thing (it will bubble a whole lot so keep your eyes and mouth shut. It doesn't actually burn your eyes though just fyi). Personally I don't like to get this product on my lips (I have very sensitive lips) so use your own method for that. Overall this is THE BEST face mask I have ever used. I have been to many dermatologists for my acne and I have tried everything from pills to washes to help my skin and nothing but THIS AMAZING PRODUCT has helped.

A day before I did the actual face mask, I tested it out on my hand to make sure it was ok. Everything was fine. The next night when we put the masks on our faces, it began to sting a little. I figured the mask was just doing its job. But then we started to feel more and more stinging. Which eventually turned into burning. We washed our faces off as soon as we could and it ended up CHEMICALLY BURNING OUR FACES. We both had extremely red, raw, and sore peeling skin for weeks. I wish I could give this product 5 stars because I really wanted to, but I can't because I almost had to go to the ER for how badly it burned me.",

The bubbles are like torture. I just want to scratch them. 2. There are no directions in the packaging. Well not in English anyway. I uploaded photos so you can see what I mean. 3. It's slimy when you start to wash it off. It takes a lot of effort to get it all off. 4. I love how fast it is. My other fave masks take 10-20 minutes. It's awesome to have a quick one! 5.

For those thinking about buying, know that the instructions and info are in Korean. However, you can find this information online, so fear not. The consistency of the mask is very goopy and you have to work fast to get it distributed across your face, otherwise it starts bubbling up. The bubbling feels funny and can itch a bit. Also, be warned that it feels a bit warm. I initially thought it was burning my face, but it's just residual heat from where the oxygen is creating a chemical reaction- thus the bubbling. After rinsing it off my face was soooooo smooth! Just make sure to put on some moisturizer because your skin will be a bit dry. In all, if you are on the fence about buying this product, give it a try! It's fun and totally worth the results!",

I got bored and once it stopped fizzing I squished it down and left it like that for about five minutes. once I wiped and then washed it off, my skin felt kinda tight, which made me worried. but, I let my face air dry and 10 minutes later I touch my forehead and its bump free!!! and my nose is super smooth!!!! all I have are reddish blotchy spots, which are going away, but I've always had those on my face (usually in between my forehead). anyways, long story short, I LOVE THIS!!! I'm planning to use it about once a week or once every other week, so my skin doesn't get deprived of natural healthy oils. 10000000/10 would recommend!!!! (I included a during & after picture)",

I even made my mom use it and she absolutely love it. The only thing i didn't like is that there are no instructions in english so i had to read it from a website. So basically after leaving this baby on your face for about 5 minutes and it's already bubbled up like crazy just massage it to your face for a few seconds then i wash it off with warm water. Make sure to use warm water and not lukewarm or cold water since this mask is so hard to remove. If your face starts getting itchy while the mask is bubbling up, it's totally normal. And it'll only last for a few minutes anyways. I then apply my regular moisturizer and my face looked so good.",

The mask was easy to remove. I used a wash cloth and warm water. My skin felt nice afterwards. It was soft, clean and felt refreshing. A few days later I started to notice changes in my skin. I began to break-out which is highly unusual for me. My cheeks became very red, raw and sensitive. The worst however was the dry flakey skin accompanied by what looked like hives on my chin and around my lower lip. They were very itchy and popped up below my lower lip in clusters. I was panicking because I have never gotten such a horrible reaction to any skin care product before. I wanted to make sure that it was indeed this product that caused the reaction on my face so I waited a week before trying it again. I reapplied this mask a week after and I received the exact same reaction as I did the first time. I will not be using this mask anymore and am very disappointed. I really wanted this mask to work well but it was not for me. If you have sensitive combination skin, please save yourself the time, money and embarrassment and DO NOT buy this product.",

I want this to work. 3.13.18 While I wanted this to work, I was highly disappointed. I found it to have a choking perfume smell. It's sticky, which makes it more difficult to use than ordinary clay mixtures and works no better for me than a good clay. It was mildly irritating to my skin, more so than my first applications of clay. While it did not cause bad itching, that could be because of years of using clay, and it did not improve over time, so I have stopped using it.",

            "review_text": "I am always looking for a good mask for my sensitive skin. I have been using a mud mask but they tend to flake everywhere while they're drying. This carbonated mask looked super fun to use so I ordered it on a whim to get me up to the one day shipping threshold. The mask comes with a small spatula under the lid and zero instructions in english, so I had to google to find out how to use it. You're supposed to apply a thick layer to unwashed skin and leave it to bubble completely, around 5 to 7 minutes. Then you can either rinse it off or rub it in, then rinse with lukewarm water. The mask is somewhat stretchier than a normal clay mask- almost like a starchy pudding. I used the spatula to apply it, and made sure that I didn't leave the container open too long. I'm not sure if it's the oils or the air that causes the reaction so I made sure to avoid contaminating the jar with either. I ended up leaving mine on for 8 minutes to get the full bubble effect, and then I tried to rinse. The bubbles came off easily but the underlying mask was harder to remove and kind of slimy. I ended up having to use a konjac sponge soaked in steaming water to get the mask off, but it came off easily with that combo. It took a LOT of rinsing to get the mask out of my sponge so make sure you use a backup one or a washcloth. My skin afterward looked super smooth and hydrated, so the work was worth it. I followed the rest of my routine and have had zero issues with this affecting my skin negatively. Overall, this is a fun mask that I would recommend to anyone looking for a twist on a clay mask. I think that it would be a good idea to use this in the shower when I try it again next week, just so it's less messy.",

We all have different skin types: my baby sister is normal-dry, my oldest sister is oily, and my younger sister and I have combination-oily skin. It comes in a cute packaging with a plastic spoon to scoop the products out (so it's very handy for those who like it clean) but I personally prefer using my hands. You have to spread it on somewhat quick otherwise the product will sit on the face and start its process of carbonating. I followed the instructions and began to feel the carbonation working its magic perhaps 1-1/2 minutes in as it warmed up my face. Massaging it after 5 minutes and rinsing it off took longer than I expected--perhaps I put too much product on? But it was quite messy. Aside from that, I would say my skin felt very smooth and cleaned. I don't know if my face brightened at all but I plan to use this more to see the long-term effects. My sisters haven't used it yet but hopefully they like it just as much as I do.",

Nothing I used seemed to improve my pores and it has always been a battle with the blemishes. I decided to give this mask a try and I couldn't be happier. It looks very similar to a normal clay mask and comes with a little spatula type tool to apply it. One thing I like is that you don't have to precleanse your face. Many masks have you wash your face, apply the mask, then wash it off. I feel like that is just too much for our sensitive facial skin. With this mask, you can just put it on (obviously don't do it on top of makeup or something). I love getting up and being able to brush my teeth, put on this mask, gather my clothes and such, and then hop into the shower to remove it. So simple! I wasn't sure what to expect, but the mask applies smoothly with the tool provided and then foams up as it is left on. Once it's all foamed up, the next step is to kind of smoosh the foam back down and massage onto your face as you would a soap. Lastly you rinse it off. When I use this mask, my face feels clean and refreshed but not dry, and I think it gives me a healthy glow. My skin also just feels lovely! When this product arrived, I had several breakouts and a particularly bad blemish in addition. After 2 uses of this mask, my skin has almost completely clear.",

            "review_text": "I bought one for myself and one for my friend. She tells me she uses it all the time and it tingles when the bubbles start to foam. she loves using it. Her daughter even uses it. I have yet to use mine because I havn't found a tool to get it out of the container yet with out using my hand and ruining the whole jar. Once agian there are no instructions on the container so if your thinking of purchasing this product, here are the instructions. How to Apply Elizavecca Milky Piggy Carbonated Bubble Clay Mask It\u2019s simply to use a carbonated bubble clay mask. While it\u2019s not necessary to wash your face first, you should ensure that you do wash your hands. You can use the mask day or night, it doesn\u2019t matter. You don\u2019t have to wash your face in advance to use the mask, as you\u2019ll be rinsing your face off after you do use it. Many women choose to use the carbonated mask as a makeup remover. However, you can also use it in the last step of your skin cleansing program if you wish. If you wear long-lasting permanent makeup, you may wish to remove your makeup first, as the clay mask may not have enough cleansing power to remove it. The Milky Piggy comes with an included spatula. All you have to do is use the spatula to remove a small amount from the jar. You can use this to scoop out about a half a tablespoon of the clay product. This also keeps the quality pure. You can use the spatula to spread it over your face, or your fingertips. Gently tap it on the skin of your face, avoiding nostrils, eyes, lips, and hairline. You should be aware that the product does foam up so you may wish to place a smaller amount on your face than you would normally for a clay mask. You don\u2019t want to overdo it then have to worry that the clay may drip off. Ensure that it\u2019s evenly spread on your face. You don\u2019t want to leave any large blobs as these may fall off and leave you wasting product. Once the mask has been applied to your face, the carbonation inside the mask will cause it to froth up. It begins to froth up as it oxidizes with the air. This process will take about three to five minutes. You\u2019ll soon see how the gooey wet clay will start bubbling up, and become frothy, foamy bubbles. You\u2019ll notice how the foam has a lighter colour than the actual clay mask product. Many people like to watch this happen in a mirror. You will also experience a gentle tingling feeling on your skin. If you wish to provide additional benefits to your skin you can also use your fingertips to gently massage the clay around your face. You can do this for about one or two minutes. Next, apply some water to your face and continue to massage lightly. This will also help to remove the mask from your face once you\u2019re done. This type of clay mask differs from other types of clay masks in that it doesn\u2019t dry out. Don\u2019t bother waiting, or you\u2019ll be waiting for a long time. After the mask has stopped foaming, or about ten minutes, you\u2019ll now be ready to use a clean damp washcloth to wipe it off your face. Use only lukewarm water. Pat your face dry and you\u2019ll see for yourself how your face is so clean and refreshed! Ideally, you should leave your face free of cosmetics, but if you must apply, wait an hour or two to do so, perhaps in the washroom at work. You should use your clay mask only two or three times a week.",

            "review_text": "I decided to give the mask a try right after I received my package. To preface, I have combo skin, with certain areas that are prone to becoming oily and irritated, while other areas can be dry. My skin is difficult to work with, and I often have a hard time finding products that will help with both oily and dry skin issues. When you use the mask, you MUST use the plastic spoon that came along with the package, as skin oil will activate the foaming ability. Once I applied it to my face, I let the mask foam up for about 10 minutes. The mask is going to foam *A LOT*, but it also provides a bit of a cooling sensation while its foaming. After 10 minutes on my skin, I went ahead and massaged the mask around my face using circular motions for 2-3 minutes, then rinsed the mask from my face. After using it, I definitely felt my skin being more well-balanced, toned, and that larger pores that I have (especially on my nose) are now visibly reduced. I'm going to give this a try on a weekly basis, and maybe increase to 2-3 times a week as my skin requires. For the price, I'm really impressed!",

Not to mention, I live in the second driest city in the US (I drink more water than seems possible in a day). Unless I use Aquaphor, my skin is flaking within hours of a cool shower. Understandably, I am nervous to try new masks, as most all of them are too drying. Not the case with this mask! I exfoliated right before use, and patted my skin dry. Then, I used the spatula provided to swipe the mask over my skin. I wiped the spatula before sticking it back into the mask in order to keep the remaining mask in the jar from foaming. By the time I had finished applying the mask to my face, it had started foaming. The foaming action felt somewhere between a tingling and an itching, but not altogether unpleasant. After 5 minutes had passed, I gently wiped away the mask with a warm washcloth. My skin looked brighter, my pores were smaller (did not remove blackheads, though they were less noticeable), and my skin felt softer. I did start to feel some of the telltale \"tightening\" that us dry-skinned folks are well acquainted with, so I finished with some Jergens Ultra Healing lotion. My skin feels and looks much better, so I am working this into my skin care regimen from here on in!",

It makes you look funny and it makes you laugh because of the tingling sensation. Unfortunately, this mask is really hard to rinse off. WHAT BUGS ME THE MOST is that it left my skin squeaky clean which usually is a pretty good indicator that it contains detergent (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate), a cheap foaming agent that will irritate and dry out your skin. I checked on cosdna website and I was right about this. Sodium lauryl sulfate is pretty much one of the ingredient that my dermatologist strongly recommend me to avoid.",

            "review_text": "I am always skeptical when it comes to the claims that skin care companies make about their various products, but I am quite pleased with the Milky Piggy Carbonated Bubble Clay Mask. To start, this mask contains the following ingredients: Water, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, White Clay, Acrylate Copolymer, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Methyl Perfluorobutyl Ether, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Lauramide DEA, TEA-Cocoyl Glutamate, Green Tea Extracts, Glycerine, Dipropylene Glycol, Bentonite, Collagen, Charcoal Powder, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Flavouring Agents, Carbonated Water, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Lavender Extracts, Monarda Didyma Leaf Extracts, Peppermint Leaf Extracts, Freesia Leaf Extracts, Chamomile Flower Extracts, Rosemary Leaf Extracts I am hesitant to use products that contain Butylene Glycol in them because it irritates my sensitive skin, but I had read so many great reviews of this mask, I thought I would give it a try. I did a small test swatch on my neck and after 24 hours, there was no reaction, so I moved on to putting it on my face. I did not develop the usual redness and itchiness that I experience with Butylene Glycol, but it does make my skin sting a bit, particularly if I am using it as one of the last steps in my cleansing process. To avoid this, on the days when I do use the mask, I use it as the first step when I wash my face. It effectively removes dirt and sebum from my pores and leaves my skin feeling quite clean, without feeling stripped and dry. You do have to apply the mask quickly as it bubbles up quickly. It takes about 10 minutes for it to reach peak bubbliness. I usually let the mask do its thing and rinse with lukewarm water after 15 minutes or so. For a deeper clean, you can massage the bubbling mask into your skin after a couple of minutes and then rinse after the usual amount of time. I have tried this and I prefer to just let it sit and do its thing. Overall, I am quite pleased with this bubbling face mask and have made it a regular part of my skincare regimen.",

            "review_text": "Okay, So my husband got me this and I just have to review it. Firstly, lets talk about what you get. You get a jar of the face mask, which has 2 lids. One is the white- creme colored one on the outside, then there is a clearish one separating the product from the air. on the Clear lid, there is a little paddle. The instructions are in another language, but here is how I use it. I scoop two little paddlefuls of the goop onto the inner whitish lid and then put the clear one back on the jar. 2 scoops is normally a generous amount. Then I talk my fingers and apply all over face. Avoid nose and mouth and eyes, this stuff puffs up nicely. I find something to do other than twitching from the tickles for about ten minutes or until it had puffed out and looks like a medium grey color ( it starts out as cloud grey). Then, since I hate having to clean this clay stuff off my sink ( the speckling globs are the worst), I use a paper towel to get the majority off my face. It sort of flattens like a souffle. I then wash the rest off with a washcloth or face scrubby. I read somewhere that it makes your face glow. I totally agree. It's fun, but the only downside I can see is waiting through tickle torture on your face for it to puff up. Other than that, I would recommend this product.",

            "review_text": "This mask is AWESOME. I originally saw an ad with a reaction video for this product and just had to try it. It took really long for it to come but thats understandable since it did come from Korea. I've used this about 4 times since i've got it and each time it leaves my face super soft. It came with two trial sized creams that were also amazing: Tony Moly goat milk premium moisture cream and Tony Moly panda's dream white magic cream. I've only used the panda's dream once, it had kind of a weird glue sort of smell to it but the goat milk cream smells light and floral. The clay mask doesn't have a smell to it. There are no English instructions on the box or jar that it comes in so I had to look that up. You put about a chestnut worth of mask on your face (I applied it with the little applicator that they have in there, I'm not sure if that was the intended purpose but it works for me) and make sure you shut the container quickly since the product seems to react with the air. The consistency is kind of thick and goopy. Then you wait about 5 minutes and the product bubbles up like crazy. Be careful not to get it too close to your eyes or nostrils when you apply it because it can burn near the eyes and since it bubbles up you don't wanna breathe it in! After the 5 minutes is up I have been rubbing it in and then washing it off with a cloth and it really has been making my face crazy soft and I absolutely recommend it!",

After about 2 more minutes I use my cheap little hand face brush (the kind you can buy at Big Lots, etc., for about $3.00 - kind of like a large round bristled toothbrush). So I brush this in circular motion around my face and let it sit for another couple of minutes. VERY refreshing with all the excellent ingredients in this mask and I definitely recommend.",

My face was dry. I kept the container open only long enough to scoop some out and immediately sealed it up.

Before I actually used this carbonated bubble clay mask, I looked at blog reviews and YouTube videos. There was a common theme and it was that this mask, as it bubbles, made their face itchy. So for a while I was hesitant to use it even when I received it as a present. However, I decided to try it out one day and you know what, it's pretty fun. You apply this to your dry face and within a minute (if not seconds) you can feel it bubble up. I assume this bubbling feel is what people meant as their face felt itchy, but I think they over exaggerated. After the mask has fully bubbled up, you massage it and let it sit for another 2 minutes before washing it off. I use this mask before I shower so I can wash it off as I'm showering. This means no more wet floors as you splash your face, trying to get that last bit of stubborn clay mask off. Do note that this mask is not like your typical clay mask in that it will dry up (or at least I've never gotten to that point). However, I do feel the result is similar to the typical clay mask that do dry up. Nothing special, it does what it states. But unlike other clay masks, this provides you with some entertainment (scary or not).",

I use this mask once a week as part of my pampering routine to clean out the oil and dirt in my pores. It works really well. I only apply it on my nose, chin and between my eyebrows since thats the black head and oily prone areas. I find that its best to apply this mask before a shower because it does leave behind soapy residue that can be hard to wash off. So i apply it before my shower and wash it off in the shower using the residue on the rest of my face. The first time i used it, it burned my face slightly (on a scale of 1-5, a 2) but after that it was fine. I'm really in love with this clay mask~",

Day 4 his nose is \"deflating\" and the blackness is now pink w light undertone of black. I wish I had taken pictures. (Incidentally I use this product on myself 3-4 times a week).

I scooped some into my palm and then applied from there. I'm sure some fancy people might use some sort of tiny bowl to transfer the product for use, but cupping it in my hand worked just fine! It made my skin feel clean and tingly, but not dry and crispy. This little jar won't sit in my cabinet and never be used like most other masks I buy!",

I wouldn't recommend using it everyday because that will dry it out but once a week will keep your skin looking bright. This is my favorite face mask because it's fun and it does the job and isn't over priced. It's fun to do with your friends or just by yourself to relax. Also, when you smooth the bubbles out after it foams it leaves this cooling sensation that feels great on your skin! 10/10 would reccomend and going to buy this product again soon!",

Way better for your skin than a biore strip and more efficient too. Make sure to avoid leaving the jar exposed to air for too long, it will activate the mask. I usually spoon a bunch on my face, close the lid and then go back and smooth the mask on. A little goes a long way, it at least expands to twice it's size so be careful around your eyes and lips (although it doesn't burn, it's just annoying foam stuck in your eyelashes).",

I panicked and ran to the sink to remove it but it's HARD TO WASH OFF! The foam on top is easy to remove, but the gray paste stuck to your skin needs scrubbing to remove. Washed off what I could and then jumped in the shower. I like my showers comfortably warm (not scalding) and the warm water made my face feel like it was burning, even after the mask rinsed off. Returned to the mirror and my skin was red and blotchy and a little itchy. It took 2 days for my skin to look normal again. I obviously have a sensitivity to something in this product. The experience was pretty scary. I will never use another commercially prepared face mask again. I will only use natural, home-made masks from now on, made from things found in the garden and kitchen. I can't gamble with the health of my skin.",

When the product bubbles, it starts to itch and sometimes tickle the face at the same time. After a few minutes, you pat around the product and turn it into a clay mask which you leave one for 10 minutes or so. Afterwards remove the mask and enjoy a cleaner and brighter looking face.",

After about 2 minutes on my face, the tingling started to feel more like a burning sensation, so I went to wash it off & I could already see my face was red. Once I finally got it off (i had to use a wash cloth to get it off faster) I had all these little red bumps all over my face. I had to immediately put aquaphor over my face to stop the burning.

As others have mentioned, I notice that the mask leaves a film behind on my face after washing it off. My face will feel tacky to the touch. I have to go back in with a face wash to remove the film.

She has normal skin so I was surprised to actually see it greasy. By then I had already ordered them so I gave them away as gifts with some bathroom sets and threw mine away.

It is kind of hard to put on as well because it literally starts bubbling as soon as it touches your skin and then rinsing it off is even worse.

I always used nose strips and they took out some blackheads but nothing compared to what I took out after I used the mask. I was disgusted and impressed. It even got some where I didn't even think I had them. So it did work for me when I used it in conjunction with a nose strip a couple of days afterwards.",

The mask comes with a small spatula which is convenient as it prevents contamination of the product and can easily scoop out the mask. I use this mask after I shower for about 10-15 minutes and then rub it in for another few minutes if I want a little extra cleansing. The consistency is \"slippery\" and you only need a little bit of it because it will start to bubble as it oxidizes. If you put too much you will have a face covered in gray foam. One thing I want to note is make sure you only put a small layer under your nose or you will end up breathing it in once it foams up (guilty of this). The scent is not to unpleasant but its no lemons and oranges either, however it didnt bother me too much. Removing the mask at its consistency can be difficult but I use a make up remover towelette to remove most of it, then start to rinse with warm water and it seems to do the trick. Make sure to remove it all around the hairline because you can breakout if product is left over (guilty of this as well). My skin is oily T-zone, sensitive, and acne prone and I found that my face felt really clean and tight afterward although my blackheads on my nose still remain so I can say that its super effective for that purpose. I use an aloe vera moisturizer after prior to going to bed and that works well to moisturize my skin to prevent dryness.",

I don't know about anyone else, but as the bubbles form, the bubbles cause my face to itch. Nonetheless, the mask does what I bought it to do: leave my face feeling and looking nice, and keep me amused while I have it on. I use it about once a week and that's enough for me.",

But those take at least 20 minutes to dry, and I don't always have that kind of time. So I love the fact that this one works more quickly, and I wanted to give it a try. Plus GlamGlow is soooooo expensive (No Zit Sherlock I can usually find at TJ Maxx, but it is a pain to peel off.) Certainly I agree with the other reviewers that this one is fun to use! It's fun to watch it foam up, and don't I look silly right before I rinse it off, and ha-ha-ha! But in my mind, a clay mask is something that needs to get in there and remove the impurities and grease from your skin. I'm not here to have fun, I'm 37 years old and my skin still breaks out, I need some results, people! And although this definitely leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth, I just don't see it getting in there and zapping zits before they develop the way No Zit Sherlock and GlamGlow do. So if your skin is pretty great to begin with, and you're mostly looking for a quick fun home spa experience, I would definitely recommend this product. But if you have some oily greasty acne-prone skin and need RESULTS, I would look elsewhere.",

I had seen a bunch of hype about it, and was so happy to find it on Amazon. I'm going to start with the Cons first, only because it's a short list. Cons: * it's hard to get the face mask on fast enough, it starts to bubble right away! *The tingling sensation of thecarbonation was almost enough to drive me mad! I wanted to itch my face so bad. This is not the face mask to relax with a glass of wine, that's for sure. *i can feel some semi dry patches on my face, so I will make sure to moisturizer well tonight. Pros: *it really does bubble, and that bubbling makes it feel like it is deep cleaning my pores. *its a quick mask, after 5 minutes I rubbed it into my skin for a minute or so, then added water and rubbed more before rinsing off. *my skin feels nice and tight *i always have tiny blackheads under my bottom lip and my nose, this mask really helped clean those out. Overall: *I did like this mask, but I can already tell that it dried my face out, but it did clean my pores out really well. I will use it again, but probably only once a month or less often.",

            "review_text": "This mask is SO GOOD. To be honest, I mostly bought it looking at the YouTuber, CloudyApples, experience with using the mask, and it just seemed really fun. But it also works so well. I have very acne prone skin, and this mask helps with acne a ton. I like to use this mask after a warm epsom salt bath so that my pores are open. When washing off the mask, you immedietly notice your skin feels so soft and smooth. Its interesting because even though it foams up, you would think its just washing off foam. But it is actually really thick, and suds up a lot when washing off - so it is quite the effort to wash off the mask - but it is worth it. The next day I notice any existing acne is significantly improved. With this mask, a little goes a long way. I have had this mask for 4 months now, and I use it 1-2 times a week, and im only almost halfway through the tub now. You only need about half a teaspoon for your whole face - which equates to one scoop of the little spatula that comes with it. If anyone is wondering, the mask does not fizz up when you open the container, it only begins to fizz once you rub it and agitate it - so I assume introducing air into it by mixing is what \"activates it\". Definietly will be purchasing this many times.",

            "review_text": "In all honesty, I was reading the bad/critical reviews on this product, and it scared me a bit. I thought this would be bad, but I ordered it anywho because the people taking videos of themselves online using this was really tempting. It arrived very quick. I ordered it Sunday night and I just got it this Tuesday. I used it when it came straight to me. Of course with the carbonation in mind, I had to use this very quick. For $11 it is quite a small amount but bubble masks don't generally come cheap anyways. In the box it comes with a spatula to make for easy application/spreading without having to use your hands/fingers. It also has a reusable plastic seal which you should keep using due to the fact it'll probably foam up without it. The texture is really goopy and thick. It's not easy getting it on the spatula with how quick you have to be so it won't start foaming, but I'd imagine with some practice it'll get easier. I took some generous globs onto my face and started smearing it around properly. Do not apply with a very thin layer because if you do the thin layer will start to foam within seconds. From then on after the application, it was just very fun watching my face get all bubbly, I couldn't help but mess around and send pictures to a few pals while I waited to wash it off. It did tickle my face a lot, so if you're someone who doesn't like to be tickled it may be a tad uncomfortable for you. I left the mask on for about 10-20 minutes. Just to see how much it foamed, I stuck a finger through it and it went pretty far down. I used a warm, wet wash cloth to get it off my skin. The bubbles made my skin fairly sudsy and soapy and the grey did not come off my face very easily but I just had to add a bit more pressure to get it off. The cloth also became fairly soapy from it and I had to frequently wring it out. When my face was dry, I was very pleased to notice that the many blackheads on my nose vanished. I also noticed that the red around some acne had disappeared, and some dry patches of skin on my face were moisturized. Even more happily, I'd like to add that with masks I got from the pharmacy, they always seemed to leave my skin shiny/oily-looking, not soft but very uncomfortably smooth, and my skin was also very tight. With this, my skin was not shiny, was both soft and a bit smooth, and my skin was not that tight. Very pleased, and very excited to use once more. I look forward to purchasing again when this jar runs empty!",

I have two complaints, neither of them major. One is that I'm pretty sure my freckles were diminished. I'm not sure why, but I'm a little bit freaked out by that. The other is that it's a bit of a pain in the ass to get off.

I love the smell since it's lighted scented and doesn't smell like a cleanser or anything that's filled with harsh chemicals. It's thick and i think moving at a decent pace will be beneficial with the carbonation process. I only tried this once and didn't get the full foaming look that I've seen but it's because I was trying to record a video and was distracted. It foamed on my forehead which was cool to see the transformation. After washing off the mask, my face was EXTREMELY soft and felt like new skin. It was sooo smooth that I thought I had baby skin. It got rid of all the impurities and I feel like my skin brightened up! Highly recommended!",

I began using 4 Korean skincare products 2.5 weeks before trying out this mask and with favorable results, so I can safely attribute my skin's bad reaction to this product. I cleansed my face and applied the mask as directed; as others have mentioned, you need to work fast as it starts to bubble very quickly. I washed it off after ~5 mins, and did like that my skin and pores appeared clean and tighter. Over the next several days, a cluster of 6-7 painful, red pimples cropped up to the left of my chin and proceeded to camp out for the next week. Only today have I begun to find some relief, following 3 consecutive days of my favorite Benton sheet masks. My skin is normal with a semi oily t-zone, but is not sensitive to many products. I rarely break out except for a pimple or 2 around the same time every month, hence my belief there's something in this mask that my skin simply hates. 2 stars for the packaging and \"fun factor\" with the bubbles. Unfortunately, I definitely will not be using again.",

Leaves my face feeling super clean and smooth. I have sensitive pale ginger skin and I didn't break out from this. It doesn't even make my face red like many other masks do. It's fun to use and feels nice. It isn't ssuper easy to wash off, for that reason Iwould recommend using it before going into the shower as it takes a bit of water to wash it all away.",

The container comes with a spatula to spread product over your face (I would not suggest using your fingers because it will cause the mask to start foaming inside the container). You don't have to spread too generous of a layer as the clay starts bubbling up almost immediately-- but do make sure to spread evenly and cover up your face-- the product will then enlarge. Your face will get kind of tingly and ticklish as it starts to become a cloud-like substance. You'll look like a piggy haha. I left it on for a good 15 minutes and then removed it from my face. The foam was easy to get off, the clay itself kind of stuck so I had to use facial cleanser to get it off (though water alone is sufficient-- as my partner removed it with purely water). MY FACE FELT RADIANT. It was... SO CLEAN. Though it did not get the little white things out of the pores in my nose, it kind of sucked them out so I was able to easily remove. This is A GREATTTTT PRODUCT for such a great price. Try it! If anything, it is atleast a super fun mask.",

Fortunately, I'm pretty lucky to have very few blemishes, whiteheads, blackheads, etc. but still wanted something to help cleanse and soften my face. This stuff is like thick yoghurt in how it smears and cools. I have mildly sensitive skin (e.g. can't use most facial moisturisers), and this caused no irritation keeping on my face for 7-10 minutes. While letting it set, the experience was rather anti-climactic as one could hear faint popping but could feel really nothing going on. This mask stays relatively moist throughout. Upon wash/\"scrub\" off, it is easy to remove; there is zero abrasiveness; it takes but 30-60 seconds to get off completely. So why 5-stars? My skin has never felt so soft and smooth. I'm not going to equate my face to a baby's arse, but you get the idea. There was no oil left; there was no cracking, as my face is prone; there was no irritation or redness; it was simply and unbelievably soft and smooth. Although I won't suggest this for any level of deep-cleansing, I will recommend it as a once a week use especially if you're trying to impress a bird. There is a very, very mild linger of odour which is rather ambiguous, and won't make anyone think you've used cologne; instead, it has a scented soap linger, which -- if I must say -- is quite enjoyable.",

It tingles a little but feels good and keep in mind, thoes bubbles REALLY bubble up so don't put too much clay around your eyes. I only use it a couple times a week but I love it!

It takes out all the excess dirt and oil, which leaves my face feeling amazing. Don't apply too close to your eyes or nose, because when the mask begins to bubble up it will block your airway/eyes. Apply quickly as carbonation begins shortly after product comes into contact with skin. Try your best to take out what you need in the beginning and spread that over your face. Once you dip the spoon (it comes with the mask pack) back into the jar the rest of the product will start to bubble up. After 10-20 mins and little to no popping can be heard coming from your face, you know product is ready to be removed. I have found that heating up a damp towel for 1 min in the micro will be the fastest way to remove the mask. Just rinse the rest off with Luke warm water.",

When you first put it on it tingles but in the best way- very similar to the way toner feels. There are no English instructions so just to help: 1) Apply a thin layer to face with spatula. Let it sit for five minutes or until completely bubbled up. 2) Once the mask is completely bubbled up, press the mask down for a deeper clean. 3) Wait for two minutes for the mask to re-bubble, then wash off. The mask should feel like a cleanser. My face does not feel dried out and cleaner than anything. I've tried the clarisonic, every face wash I could find, oils, but this mask changed the game. My face feels soft, exfoliated and cleaner than anything. I highly suggest. I am addicted",

Seemed like a total win. Plus, a BUZZFEED employee liked it and they are infallible, right? Yup, like the Pope. Well, it didn't do any harm, but it did not provide me with any results either. True that the bubbling part felt fun--but I can achieve the same thing with a variety of safe acids and bases, like scrubbing with baking soda + coconut oil, and then adding 1/3 watered down apple cider vinegar. I still had all my blackheads, using a Biore strip afterward didn't help either (I thought maybe the mask \"brought them to the surface\") and same goes for said process in reverse. Turns out this item is non refundable. So Milky Piggy and I will be roommates for a while, until maybe I can pawn her off onto my teenage niece or the tweens I babysit for a \"spa night\"",

Easy application - there's a little scoop included that keeps it sanitary, and the product is thick but spreads easily. Interesting experience - it starts off feeling chilly and awesome, but by the time the five minutes are over, my face was absolutely full of carbonated bubbles that got more than just a little tickley... it sounds cute and fun, but it really gets kind of itchy Difficult removal - I washed the mask off in the shower, and that's what I would recommend... the bubbles get wet and reabsorb the mask into the skin, making removal a little strenuous Clean and clear results - my face felt super clean and I didn't experience any post-mask breakouts",

The clay is VERY thick and a little difficult to wash off but I recommend putting it on before a shower. The directions say to rub it in after about 3 minutes and then let sit some more. This is perfect for the shower because once you rub it in, your hands are covered in a very thick clay/foam substance. It's definitely a fun product and I can see some change in my skin too.

It starts to bubble really fast too like within seconds of applying a thin layer on my face you can see and feel it start to bubble, so you might have to put it on really quick. All of the direction is in Korean so I have to search for the direction online and most of it was apply an even, thin layer on the face and wait five minutes, then \"gently\" massage your face for about two minutes before washing it off. Washing it off is a little difficult as the clay mask is really thick. I have combination skin and really oily around my T-zone, but after using this mask my skin feels soft and tighter after washing it off, so I usually put on some moisturizer. However, I do not find it work on removing my blackheads. After using up the whole product, my blackheads is still present as before. Another problem I find is that when I open up the container, the top layer of the clay mask is alway bubbling, so I am not sure if it is because I let the clay come in contact with the air for long. I take a glob of the clay with the small scooper they give you and quickly close it, but it does not work. I also wash the scooper to prevent any oil or dirt that came from my face to come in contact with the clay mask.",

After using this 3 times a week for a month now, my skin is as soft as my toddler's. My dryness issues have all but cleared up and my pores don't seem as big. It bubbles and almost tickles as it dries. Then, once it is done, you have the option to smooth the bubbly solution on your face for more treatment. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with skin issues. My sister has sensitive skin and uses this when she comes to visit and she loves it. It doesn't leave any redness, just smooth and silky skin. The only downside is that the directions come in Japanese/Chinese and I had to google the directions (and watch the review video again).",

It definitely makes your face itch/tingle as others stated, bearable but irritating to ignore. It is very fast acting so you need to put the lid on as much as possible, the product will bubble in the container and be useless if left off for too long. When you rub the product in after letting it bubble, it feels like a regular clay mask, very thick and slimy. My biggest issue was getting that off my face. My sink was a mess because it required a lot of water and rubbing. I will be using this before a shower because it will be easier to rinse it off in there afterwards. I used it on my 5 year old as well, just on cheeks and chin to avoid any eye contact, and she loved it, except for that tingling. It is very funny but hard to ignore. I'm glad that I tried it but will probably not repurchase when I use it up",

            "review_text": "Alright, so here's the full extent of the product! If I could this probably would get a 4.5 instead of a 5, but overall the product was pretty great :) Shipping: I ordered this maybe 2 and a half weeks ago (on standard shipping) and it showed up really early, so for that a 10/10! Very much appreciated, and will be buying this from this company again! :) Instructions: I knew ahead of time that I was going to need translated instructions. Many people said that in other reviews when I did my research. That, I'm totally cool with. The instructions I read told me to have this on my face (dry, so there's no washing before hand) for five minutes. I'm not gonna lie, I went ahead and did ten minutes instead, because I didn't set a timer, and my skin does feel better! So, I'm going to keep doing ten minute intervals instead of five. 9.5/10 (And finally...) Product: For me, I had a lot of fun using this product with my sis! The consistency of the mask is about the same as pudding, and smells like a really earthy hair salon. (which to me smells nice, but some might disagree) On my first go, I had a hard time getting this stuff on even. It starts to bubble pretty quick, so you're gonna need to hurry getting this stuff on! There are two lids, the outer lid, which is for decoration really, and the other to keep the mask air tight. It IS a bit difficult to get this open and perfectly closed without nails! When I went to apply this stuff to my sis, I applied a much more even coat, and it's definitely showing! Her skin is much softer and shines a bit better. The only problem I had here was after I used the mask for my sister, I started seeing the mask foam inside the container, which worries me a bit, hoping it won't effect the overall usefulness of this stuff! Make sure you keep this stuff closed when not using with the inner lid, and make sure it's on TIGHT! Overall 9.6/10! Will be buying again and scaring my family with the foam face (because they all seem to find it scary looking when it foams! \ud83d\ude02)",

I probably would have just given it to a friend and then forgotten about it. What makes me feel I have to write a review of this is the smell. If you are at all sensitive to scents or perfumes, DO NOT BUY THIS. I knew upon opening it that I shouldn't use it. I knew as soon as I put it on my face that I shouldn't have. I should have know better than to even buy it, but all the videos and reviews of people having fun with the bubbles were too tempting. I could smell it on my skin after an extremely thorough wash, and washing again hours later. Even my hands were perfumed, hours later. Again, this mask is extremely perfumed. If that's your thing, you'll probably enjoy it. If you're like me, you'll spend the rest of your day regretting even touching the stuff.",

After 15 minutes, I wash it off in the shower. You do not need cleanser afterwards. This takes off all makeup, dirt, etc. My face feels soo soft. I applied toner just to make sure that all the makeup is removed, and there is nothing on the cotton ball. Unlike other masks, my face is not red after washing it off. Instead, I look like I just got a facial. My skin is oily and clog-prone. This mask does not clog me and really does pull out all the gunk out of your pores. I did not experience any 'purging' after using this mask. I'm definitely very happy with this purchase.",

My complexion has cleared up a great deal in the last few months since changing up my skin care routine, which includes this mask. So, while I can't credit the clear complexion solely to this mask, it's probably a part of it. I use it after doing a green tea steam every Saturday. Then I follow it up with rosehip oil. I have extremely dry skin and if you do, too, I wouldn't recommend using it more than once or twice a week as it is rather drying. However, if used with a good moisturizer, it seems to help keep pores clean. The bubbling sensation after the steam is quite relaxing and the mask has a good, clean scent. The price is reasonable and a little bit of this mask goes quite a ways so I anticipate the jar, while small, will last me quite a while.",

It was very fun to use, and I could honestly see results immediately after. My face felt amazingly soft, I could see my pores were actually cleaned out. Normally my face will feel clean after washing, but within a couple hours its really oily and gross. With this mask, my face felt soft and fresh all through out the following day (did not put on the next day). Was able to wear makeup without it looking cakey or greasy all day. It did not dry my face out either. I reapplied this morning to help maintain the oil production, and my face still feels amazing. I'm amazed with how well this stuff has controlled the access oil without drying my face out. It's been a long time since I have felt this beautiful and confident without having to cover my natural face. Will definitely be buying more!",

I rated 3 stars based on what her take was on it.She wants more and i will order another when this is low. I will say it didnt break her super sensitive skin out thankfully and she swears her face feels very clean after use.If this is what it takes to not only keep her happy, amused and good hygiene than im all for it.Mybe after several months of using twice a week we will see results.",

Nothing diferent. No glow, no soft. I don't know where all this positive reviews comes from but they are totally not true. It is just clay (no active charcoal) and alka seltzer.

So far, it's very close to everything I've been looking for in a mask. I'm going to use it again later this week and hopefully for better results. The only reason I give 4 stars right now is because I was expecting my pores to be so clean that they are almost invisible, like the girls in the videos and pictures I've seen. If I can achieve that after a few uses, I will come back and give 5 stars. Changing my review to 5 stars! I used this, for the 2nd time, last night and had even better results. I will go as far as to say that this is the best face mask I've ever used.",

As soon as you put it on you start feeling it bubble up and start doing its thing. I left it on for maybe 15 to 20 minutes and the mask expanded/bubbled up to an inch thick, so near the eye area you should be careful to how close you put it on. I feel like I put it to close to my eyes once it expanded when I blinked I would get it on my eye lashes. There are no English directions on the box or the jar so I really wasn't sure how to take it off. I had rubbed a small spot on the side of my face with my finger and it came off easily, but when I rinsed with water it seemed to thicken up and made it a little harder to rinse off. I really liked the mask I liked that you could really feel it bubble up and work, I do feel you should use a pore clearing peel off mask after (It had brought the dirt to the surface and could see some of my pores were clogged).

I don't have bad skin & I'm only 36 so I don't really know what to expect from products like these. I was hoping it would help with the blackheads on my nose but to be honest I can't tell a difference. My face doesn't feel really dried out after, so that's a plus. Even if I don't know exactly what it's doing, I'll keep using it. The smell isn't offensive or pleasant, it's just kind of \"meh.\" But for a product that sits on your face I think meh is the best. I'm sensitive to strong perfumes so I wouldn't have enjoyed a really fragrant face product.",

Applying it was a little tricky since you have to work pretty fast before it starts to activate and bubble. It has a small ticklish stinging sensation for the 5 minutes that you let it bubble, but I would equate it to a sort of pop rocks for your face. After that, we rubbed it into a mask and let it sit for 2 minutes before washing it off. Be warned, you will most likely need a wash cloth or towel to get this off as it sticks pretty well even with water. It's currently the day after first use and my face still feels pretty soft. Definitely looking forward to using this again and it's interesting enough to make the mask process fun instead of tedious.",

I used it about 10-15 minutes before I shower and when I first apply it I leave it on for about 5 minutes until i see its completely bubbled and then I just rub the bubbles until they have the clay consistency and leave it on like that for about another 5 minutes. Then when I am in the shower I wait for the clay to soften a little and rub it in my face until it has like a soapy consistency thanks to a little bit of water and use that sort of as a cleanser.

Saw this on a few social media ads and decided to try it out myself. I had to look up directions since it was all in Korean. You don't have to clean your face before you use it. There's a small spatula provided. I didn't want to keep dipping the spatula in the clay after it had touched my dirty face so I kept a damp paper towel and wiped it each time I needed to get more. After applying it...you get to watch your face grow!! It does tingle from the bubbles. After about 10-12 minutes, you pat it all down and massage it into your skin. You wait for another 5 minutes and then you rinse or wash it off! Dry your face and voil\u00e0, you're beautiful again! I gave my husband, my little brother, his girlfriend, my 6 year old son, and my mom the bubble facial and all you heard throughout our house was laughter! And I still have half the jar left...",

I spent the whole time with the mask on popping the bubbles that were almost reaching my eyes. After about 10 minutes I wet my hands and massaged the mask into my skin. While massaging it felt like any other clay mask and felt very soothing. I rinsed it off with warm water and a wash cloth. After I applied my nightly face creams and serums. My skin felt very smooth and clean after using it. This is both a novelty and useful product. My kids liked watching the bubbles grow and I liked the way my skin felt after using it!",

First of all, the packaging is cuter than anything else ever, but you open it and, call me crazy but you can literally smell that this stuff is quality. So for about ten minutes I'm just sniffing it. It smells fresh and not even a little chemically and the only downside I can see is that if my face smells like this all the time, I will do nothing but smell my own face forever and lose my job, all my friends and my home, spiralling into a pit of poverty and despair, which brings it down from a solid 12/10 to about an 11.5/10. So, then I took a small amount and put it on the back of my hand and it bubbled, so I don't know but if that's not cute to you, no offense but you're Satan. I'll buy this forever, thanks bye.",

This mask does well to cleanse your face a couple times a week to remove excess dirt/grime/makeup/products that linger on the face. It activates within a couple seconds, so apply it quickly. It itches as it cures; which is around 5 minutes. After it has cured rub it in a little more for a couple minutes then rinse off. It takes some effort to rinse it off after which is kind of lame. The ingredients in this mask are no nonsense and non comedogenic. I wouldn't say this mask is super awesome, just because It doesn't have any AHAs/BHAs or anything that necessary helps with acne. But cleansing your face does, so I think this mask helps. Overall, good mask, good price, and serves its purpose. Shipping took around 3 weeks which though.",

I left it bubble for about 5 minutes then wet my hands and rubbed it in. 5 more minutes then I washed it off. I suggest using a wet rag to help take it off because it's really thick and doesn't wash off easily. My face felt amazing afterwards. It felt super clean without having that tight feeling most masks leave. And I have oily skin, but it didn't make my face more oily like most other masks. My face didn't even feel gray the next day!

It's still a good mask even when it's not full of bubbles, though. It does a very good job of getting the crud in your pores to come to th surface, but it does this by slightly agitating the skin so your skin could become a little irritated if you leave it on for too long.

It tingles and tickles during this process, and after ten minutes I washed it off with warm water and a wash cloth. This is a clay mask, so it can be drying and is supposed to pull impurities to the surface of the skin. Be sure to moisturize properly immediately afterwards and avoid overusing any type of clay mask! Every skin type is different and different seasons and climates should dictate whether your skin needs a clay mask or moisturizing mask.",

All the instructions are in Korean and while I completely understand that it is a Korean face mask, I was really hoping for some kind of instructions separately in English. I had no idea how to use it and had to look it up to learn what to do. Not a huge deal but a bit of an inconvenience. I won't be buying again but I will happily use the container I have! :)",

I've been using this every night since I received it(4 days) and my skin feels so soft and smooth after using it. My skin has also already improved since i've been using it, my acne seems to be healing, and black heads are disappearing. I also like the fact that I do not have to wash my face before using it, it removes my makeup off of my skin in the process. It's also made up of natural oils, and materials so that is a must for me also. Amazing Product!",

Upon inspection after using this mask I was completely amazed. My face felt cleaner than it has in a very long time. AND my pores looked amazing! I don't remember a time when I felt like my pores looked great before using this mask. I would highly recommend this mask to anyone. It's also so much cheaper than the GlamGlow ones I have been using (and didn't see near these results from)",

I usually put this on when I think my pores need a clean up and let me tell you it definitely cleaned them out . When applying to your face make sure it's clean . Apple an even amount and pretty soon your skin will start to itch like crazy but that's bc it's working . Leave it on for 15 minutes then for an extra deep clean rub the foamy product all over like a mask . Leave it on for another 5 minutes and it will start to foam again. The results are OH WOW!!",

They provide a little spatula, which is very helpful for scooping the product out since I had a hard time scooping it out with my fingers. Consistency is thick, light, and jiggly, almost like mousse. I would use this in my facial routine. Be sure to close it tightly or else the product inside the jar will start to foam up. Will I use this often? Yes, maybe once a week. Do I recommend it to others? Yes Will I buy it again? Maybe",

I love this for my skin, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin, since it will often leave my face red for a short while after using. It's also quite messy and a handle to clean up, so that's another downside. But above all this mask is always fun and I love taking selfies with it on.",

The very first day, I used it and I have to say that it does not smell bad like some people have said, at least I don't find the odor unpleasant. Anyway, it so fun to use this product because it starts foaming up almost immediately and in the end, you end up looking like you've had an allergic reaction because your face looks as if it has swollen up (with the product on). Like I said, it's very fun/amusing. After rubbing it in, it kind of acts like soap. So, you do not need to wash your face with soap after the product. The end result (even after the first day) is quite nice. It leaves your face feeling smooth and refreshed.",

Now with that said I have a ton of pores, and this facial wash has had the best results for me out of all the washes I've used before. Surfice it to say I'd recommend this product to any and all.

Wow is all I can say I struggle from horrible blackheads, large pores, and your occasional acne (whiteheads) brake outs this product is a god send I didn't want to believe the hype but just wow, the foam honestly deep cleaned my pores all around my nose and on my chin are not blackhead free but defiantly a whole lot better after just one use!!

If you\u2019re looking for the funny factor, leave it on longer than they recommend and it will get REALLY fluffy. I am only giving it 2 stars bc even when I washed my face after the recommended time, my skin felt greasy. I washed it with my normal cleanser but everytime I use it, the next day my face breaks out. Maybe it means it\u2019s working and it brings everything out of my pores, but I don\u2019t want a mask that causes pimples!",

If you use too much the mask bubbles up A LOT! It felt a little funny, but after taking the mask of my skin was really clean. The mask did cause little whiteheads to appear the next morning, but i quickly cleaned them up, and there was no blemish afterwards! My face was a little dry after washing off the mask, so i used a night cream over night to prevent break outs. The next morning, I went through my normal routine and went to work, and I actually got comments that I looked more refreshed that day! Love this stuff, I will for sure purchase this mask again.",

The foaming action tickles, but that means it's working. I used this face mask with my sister and we couldn't look at each other without laughing. I would recommend using this with another person to add to the enjoyment. I plan on looking at their other products and buying more masks.",

It took a few uses for me to realize this. When you apply a thin layer (one spatula full!), it's much less itchy and irritating when it bubbles up, easier to wash off, and in my opinion, more effective. It's a gentle mask that doubles as a cleanser, and it a great one to do with other boyfriend- my boyfriend is also a big fan. I love how quick it is, also, it's a nice boost when my skin is lackluster. When I've used it my skin is exfoliated, soft, and I notice soothed acne in a day or two. Another fast mask I quite like: Biore Self Heating One Minute Mask, .25 oz each, 4 Count",

I can't speak for long term use but after using it my skin feels so amazing. It is slightly drying but I followed it up with a light gel moisturizer and it was totally fine. Application was easy and I actually really like the little spatula it comes with but, you do have to work kind of fast because it does start bubbly very quickly and once it starts to bubble it's basically impossible to put more in that spot. Waiting the five minutes is slightly uncomfortable because of the tickling from the bubbles but honestly I was laughing so hard because of how ridiculous it looks all bubbled up that it really didn't bother me. Once you rub it in its just like any other mud mask. When you begin to rinse it off it gets sudsy which is nice but I did have to use a soft washcloth to get it off. Overall it's a really good, fun mask at a good price. Definitely worth a try.",

After 5 minutes I massaged my face and added some water to my hands and massaged too like it says to. it foamed up a little again and then I washed it off with water. One thing I would say I didnt like was that It was so difficult and messy to get it all off in the sink that I ended up hopping in the shower. Do I notice a difference? Actually yes, my face is soft and noticed my pores on my cheeks looked clearer. I gave this 5 stars because i did see a difference in my pores and that's the whole reason I bought it.",

I've allowed a few friends to try, some say it tickles but 4/5 were satisfied with the results the mask yielded. It smells pleasant and is a fair amount for the price.

You need to put on this mask very fast since they start to bubble up immediately, and I always just quickly put a couple of scoops on my cheeks, chin, and forehead, and close the container so the mask in the container will not start bubbling up. Then I spread it around evenly and jump in my shower. I do make sure my face won't get that wet when I'm washing my hair though. It's such a cute and interesting feeling to feel the clay mask start to bubble up, and I can hear them sizzling! After around 6 mins, I will smear them around my face, rub it in a little and just wash it off in the shower. It takes a little time to wash it off since it's not instantly gone like soap foam. And boom that's it. After that my face is super smooth! I haven't seen any other effect other than it takes my face smooth, and once I didn't put it on my forehead and I can feel a big different in terms of smoothness between my forehead and other parts of the face. It hasn't made me break out at all so that's good! All in all, I think it's fun and cute and makes your face smooth (gets rid of dead skin etc. etc.)",

However, what intrigued me most was the tingling sensation I felt almost immediately \u2014 before I'd even finished applying it to my entire face. It sort of felt like someone was popping a sheet of miniature bubble wrap on my face (note: you need to aware that you should not apply this stuff around your nose or eye because it will take you minutes to wipe it away from those areas before preparing for even bigger bubble). The mask had done a wonderful job since it manages to suck the gunk and dirty from my skin and still not be stripping . My skin was smooth, my pores were practically non-existent and even after all that scrubbing (with rough, office paper towels, no less), my face wasn't red or irritated at all. I highly recommend you try this at home.",

I'm glad I put coconut oil on my eyebrows and eyelashes because it foamed over my hair even though I gave it a good amount of room. It was hard for me to wash off because it keeps foaming.

If you leave the top off the jar while you apply it to your face the mask in the jar will begin to foam. So take out a scoop and close the jar back right after then apply the scooped out part to your face. This mask left my face nice and smooth and not tight feeling. I use it once a week.",

It has a neutral scent and leaves the skin soft, etc. like other masks. Many people say that this is just for fun, but it does have good ingredients to help get rid of oil and dirt from the skin like other masks, it just comes with the added benefit of bubbling up on your face!",

The only two things that made it a little time consuming were that you have to look up the directions in English( considering it's a Korean product) and also it takes a good 10-15 minutes to wash it off well and doing it the way they tell you too. Instead of massaging my face, I took a rag and took the easy way out of it. Also don't leave the lid open for a long time or else the product will bubble up and dry out to the point where you can't use it anymore, so close the lid after your done applying it to your face. Also another tip is to not apply it too close to your nostrils, eyes and mouth, because it will take over your face! Awesome product totally recomend it to the beauty Grus.",

Some tips for future buyers : -Don't put too much at once. Apply as thin layer as possible (with your finger, since mini spatula scratched my face once) because it will get airy enough later on. If it's too thick, you'll need more force to wash it off later and damage skin more ! - Once it turns into cloudy texture, put little water to massage in a muddy texture. Then add more water. You'll feel the mud softening. In the end, add a lot of water and turn the mud into foam. It produces A LOT of foam, and I'm even thinking of using it everyday as my foam cleanser. If anything amazing happens after daily use, I'll add more words to my review for sure ! - Right after you're done washing off, apply a thick ! layer of moisturizer and sleep. Next morning, my skin felt so so so smooth. (The container says it has variety of natural oils within, and I wonder if it's true considering such cheap price. I guess I'll just have to trust the manufacturer. )",

Quick pros and cons: the tingling sensation is pleasant, it left my face very moisturized, and the little spatula/cap thing is cute and sanitary. I liked using the mask but it's not my favorite. You don't get a ton of product but a little goes a long way (trust me, be skimpy otherwise your eyes and nose will be filled with bubbles lol). There's a mild smell that I didn't enjoy. There are no instructions in English so I just applied it after washing and drying my face and hoped for the best. It's pretty hard to wash off, I highly recommend using a washcloth. And I found the little crackling sound of the bubbles kind of annoying. But overall it was interesting and my face felt pretty good after so I'd say if you've got money to spare give it a shot, but if you're saving up for a go-to mask, there are better ones with better prices. Hope that helps",

Within seconds it started to foam up and it felt like little bubbles popping all over my face. After 5 minutes I removed the product and my skin looked great. It obviously didn't give me new face but it did brighten and seem to clear out some of the huge craters called pores on my face.

I have very very sensitive skin and was scared to try it but I'm glad I did! The shipping was fast and packaging was super nice. The cons of this product would have to be the smell how fast it foams up,& it's not that easy to wash off but that's about all. This is so fun for everyone of any age!

I have had this product for over two weeks and have noticed an extreme improvement in my skin condition! I use it 2-3 times a week and have not had any issues with ingredients in the product. The bubbles DO tickle though. I will say my husband (who has EXTREMELY sensitive skin) tried this (I made him) and he said it felt like it burned, but his face didn't get red or anything, so if you have sensitive skin, just be careful :)",

Texture: - Upon application it was a Cold, Gel like consistency. It was funny, kinda felt like I was putting pudding on my face. - After a few minutes it becomes a bubbly foam which you then press and work into your skin - Once you've pressed it in, you notice that it's now more of a muddy consistency. - Here comes the difficulty, washing it off took some time. I suggest wiping it off with a towel first and then washing the remainder Thoughts: It bubbled up before I was able to apply it to my entire face so I feel as though you have to work pretty quickly. I mean it was fun to take pictures and stuff. Safe for sensitive skin I suppose because I tried it on my daughter who also enjoyed playing with it. Results: - Face felt clean. Like bar soap squeaky clean. However, I feel like the same thing could be achieved with a good cleanser or bar soap. Didn't do much for my black heads and stuff. I mean, it got the makeup off but man oh man it was so much work. A bit pricey for the product and I wouldn't buy it again. It definitely isn't a go to mask or holy grail, but if you're looking for something fun lol.",

Let it sit for 15 more minutes, then go back to rinse. It slightly dries out my face but it's the only mask I've had so far that has really made my skin feel brighter and cleaner.

You have to be kind of quick when applying it if you want to get your face evenly coated before it starts bubbling up, but the slight tingly sensation is nice and cooling, and your face feels soft and refreshed afterwards. I will say it took more muscle to remove than I would've initially guessed, but since you are putting clay goop on your face, I suppose it makes sense. I still have to wash, wash, double check, then wash more because there are always a handful of spots you didn't get washed off completely the first few minutes of rinsing. Like others, I watched a few youtubes for instructions first, and don't be mislead by people saying how messy this stuff is. I have had zero problems with it making a mess, and it won't \"get everywhere\" as long as you're not a mini-spatula-wielding maniac. I will say that it does expand once it bubbles up, so yea, if you put it too close to your nostrils initially, you will probably get some up your nose once it has puffed up. The kids are young and still have perfect skin, and I can't say that I have skin problematic enough to say that this \"helped\" in any long term way, but it's still a fun pampering activity, and your face will definitely feel and smell wonderful after.",

When done your face itself looks like a huge bubble, it's quite fascinating. I kept the mask on for 10 minutes. Afterwards I used wet hands to rub the product in, then I washed with warm water.

It does bubble up like crazy so I only use a walnut size. Also, when you apply this make sure you close the lid right away so you don't waste the product because it will bubble up if you leave it open. What I do is after I let the bubbles sit for 5 mins, I rub it in and it turns into a clay mask, then after that I wait 15 min and wash it off, that's how I notice the best results. My best friend has bad acne and sensitive skin and she loves it! One day I thought she had foundation on but she told me it was just her face! Huge improvement, I highly recommend this stuff!!!!",

I don't understand how other people washed it off so easily, but when I try to wash it with water, the mask turns into a soap and makes my face all sudsy. It also gets into my hair. The solution I had to this was using the mask before showering so it's easier to wash off in the shower.

Overall, I would recommend this product only if you want to experience the bubbling effect lol. It wasn't really worth it to me since I was looking for an effective mask with different needs. This was more of a spur of the moment purchase but it was fun haha.",

Plus, the whole process for using this mask is fun. You just spread on the mask with the little spatula provided and wait. After about 3 minutes, you will turn into some sort of hilarious cloud monster. Then, just rub in the mask and wash off. Pat your face dry and enjoy the results!",

It has helped minimize my pores and has eliminated any blackheads - plus has made my skin smooth; however, I still follow up with a moisturizer. The mask is a little bit messy when removing, so I recommend putting it on just before a shower. Also, when you're finished taking the clay out of the container, but the lid back on asap. It will start to bubble if you leave it open and exposed to air. Another amazing thing - it arrive a month early! Don't let the shipping date fool you :-) I will be purchasing this item again.

I feel like this mask does a good job of cleaning out my pores. However it's also a bit of a nuisance to use. I find it hard to spread the mask evenly with the paddle and it also always gets into my hair every time! Even if I don't put it very close to my hairline, it either happens as I'm applying or when I'm washing the mask off since it foams up into a fairly thick lather. I have a lot of fine wispy hairs around my hairline, so maybe this is not a problem for everyone, but it is definitely a hassle for me. I'm glad I bought this clay mask but am not sure I'd get it again.",

I was scrolling through my facebook newsfeed and there was this girl who did a video review of this carbonated bubble clay mask. I watched said video and thought wow that's neat if nothing else. I purchased it right away and it came rather quickly. I opened the product and followed the directions and I was amazed. The carbonated bubbles started working extremely quickly. The bubbles did make my face itch while they were working on my skin. By experiencing that effect I knew this product was doing something. I then massaged it in some more to get whatever other dirt and oil was on my skin to loosen up then I proceeded to wash off my face with warm water. This product is a little hard to wash off, but not impossible. I love this product and I'm glad I saw the review because I have never seen or heard of this carbonated bubble face mask before. I'm glad I purchased it. I would definitely recommend this bubble mask to anyone who would like a fun experience and a cleaner face. This mask did not get every single one of the black heads out, but it did do it's intended job and I'm pleased with the results.",

After using it a few times with the snail cream by the same brand, my skin started breaking out, flaking, blackheads coming out, and very dry. I immediately stopped and went to back my usual skincare product that makes my skin look awesome, and my skin is much better.... i think that it will be great for other people's skin.. but for me, I can only stick with one product. too bad because i really want to like it.",

            "review_text": "This little mask is so much fun to use! It's super easy to apply and remove, pretty gentle on my more sensitive skin, and leaves me feeling smooth and refreshed. The carbonation feels almost like you're being lightly tickled and it's entertaining to listen to the tiny bubbles pop. It comes with a spatula to apply so a mask brush is unnecessary. The mixture itself is pretty thick and some carbonation in between uses is expected after contact with the spatula. After massaging and washing off, the mask brightens skin, moisturizes, and refreshes. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to get into Korean beauty products, especially as a first non-sheet mask!",

            "review_text": "I've always admire Korean skincare products, so this definitely caught my eyes. When I placed the order it said it would arrive on so and so date, but afterwards the date changed to 2 days before then which is great. It even arrived a few hours earlier on that day. The package was sealed and new - everything looked good. I used the clay mask that evening and at first didn't really feel a difference, but a few minutes later I felt that my skin seemed softer. Container: You would think the entire container holds the clay but there's about 1/4 in of space from the bottom that does not hold anything. So when you think about it the product is pretty pricey, which is why I would not use it everyday. I would probably use it once every week or so. Product: It has a really nice smell to it, not like clay. I tried it on my hand first just to see if there was an allergic reaction, which of course there was none. It felt really nice when I first put it on because it was cool and smooth. Some people says it tickles their face when it's bubbling, but that's not the case for me. Tips: I would recommend putting the mask on before you shower, so that afterwards you can just wash your face while you're showering. It can get a little messy throughout the entire process. Before openid, get a little dish to hold the amount you want and then IMMEDIATELY close the clay container after you scoop that amount out so it's not exposed to air for a long time while you're trying to put on the mask. Make sure to NOT put too much on your face; a little goes a long way and if you put too much it takes longer to wash the mask off. When you put the mask on you have to do it as quickly as possible because the moment it hits your skin it will start bubbling. Once it starts bubbling it's hard to spread that onto other parts of your face. I also recommend you wash and dry the little spoon/spreader that comes with the package after every use. This is a product to try and it's also pretty funny to see your face surrounded by gray puffs. :)",

            "review_text": "Regardless of what I am about to say, this is worth the money purely for the novelty of it. I mean, it turns you into a bubble monster, and you cant help but giggle. Very cute packaging. Inside is a little spatula to help put the product on your face. It foams up so quickly both on your face and in the jar that i found my fingers did a better job. Its very thick and gooey, almost like partially dried glue. no noticeable smell, bad or good. I found instructions online that said put it on an uncleaned and dry face, leave it on for 5 minutes then wash it off. I left it on for much longer to see how much it would bubble. It bubbled for the full 10 minutes before I couldn't handle the tickling feeling anymore, and it started to block the air getting to my nose (so in the future, I wouldn't put this on my \"mustache\" area). This mask did not irritate my skin, but what did irritate my skin is taking it off. Remember how I said it is very thick? Yea. So it took several minutes of washing off with a textured towel. it bubbled up (soap like bubbles, not carbonated bubbles) as i was washing it off, which combined with the instructions saying to put it on an unwashed face, point this more in the direction of a cleanser. Because of its cleansing properties, I would call this more of a cleanser than a mask, but either way, it worked. Assuming that i got all the thick goo off of my face, I would call this a pretty good cleanser (though i didn't try it over makeup, to see if that would come off). it did clear out some of my finer pores. I felt that it was kind of drying, so i followed up immediately with a heavy duty night time moisturizer. Tips: for easier removal and application, go with a thin layer all over your face. But, for first time users, go for a nice thick layer for maximum bubbles! 4 stars because it literally has the texture of glue, and i am not a fan of jar-style products, due to air exposure, bacteria, and higher likelihood of drying out before you finish using the product. Sadly, this is far too thick to even think about putting it into a dispenser. But, this does not kill the joy!",

I prefer to use my fingers because the scooper it comes with is kind of awkward. It starts to bubble quickly. Leave it on for 10 minutes and then rub it around your face. The slightly irritating part of this is taking it off. After a few uses I have found using a wet warm washcloth to remove the majority of it works the best (it doesn\u2019t stain at all) and then rinse any remaining residue off with water. I say this because it is a very thick product and kind of slippery I guess would be the word, so its kind of difficult to get off with wet slippery hands. Another word of caution it is carbonated. I know it says it on the bottle but I just didnt really think about it and was pretty surprised by the reaction on my face. Tiny little bubbles popping and can get sort of irritating, and sometimes you REALLY want to rub your face. It is not unbearable and worth it. This stuff works miracles on my black heads, and my skin feels awesome. I will say that I definitely feel like I need to moisturize afterwards but you should anyway. Sometimes I uses a moisturizer sheet mask after and with the two combined my face feels amazing. Also, it\u2019s fun!",

I have big pores and intentionally made my face very dirty. On a part of my cheek I put the mask without cleansing, on another part I cleaned first, then put the mask on.

I was pleasantly surprised by the borderline tingling sensation on my skin, as the mask reacted with the oils in my skin and bubbled up. I did want to see what would happen if I left the mask on longer than the 3-5 minutes on the directions, and went for 10 minutes; it did bubble up a little more, but it wasn't considerably different from the 5 minutes. I would recommend leaving a half-inch to an inch of space beneath your eyes; it did bubble up enough to touch my lower lashes and when I blinked it got onto my top lashes. Also be aware of the product around your nose, that will also bubble up, and you don't want the risk of it going up your nose! So, don't put the clay on your upper lip (I didn't, because breathing is important!).

Some cures are expensive, or time-consuming, or (in this case) INDESCRIBABLE TORTURE. Strap me to a boulder and let vultures chew out my innards, fine, but do I have to do the mask? In the end, I do apply the mask. It's a few moments of the worst tickle I've ever had the displeasure to endure. Tingling, the description says. Sure, if a million tiny little animals swarming your face is tingling, why not. I literally have to do deep breathing exercises to get through this mask - I have to go to some sort of meditation trance happy place to distance myself from the skin-melting tickle. I've also found squats and lunges to be helpful as a distraction, but sitting still is straight out. (Do be careful not to snort in the mask in a particularly thought-cleansing inhale. You will not enjoy the experience.) And my pores. They're looking better. But at what cost? I'm supposed to be doing the mask right now.

It was pretty thick so it easily spread on my face in an even layer, it was also very smooth which I love because I often find hat clay masks are gritty. (The little applicator it comes with deserves a review all on itself. I love this touch!! So much easier to apply and much more sanitary, and the fact that it fits right in the jar is awesome, so nice if I ever take it with me on vacation or something) I gave it about 10 minutes even though the package says 5 because I wanted to see if it would keep bubbling (hint: it does) and STILL my skin was radiant after. So clean and smooth but also so so soft! When I woke up the next morning the acne on my chin had completely stopped swelling and dried up, but not the usual gross scabby dry, like a very nice unnoticeable healed skin. The rest of my complexion was noticeably more even, the redness around my nose and on my cheeks had gone down, and again my skin was so soft! I\u2019m absolutely going to keep using this once a week, replacing my regular clay mask. Note: my skin is in between oily and dry. I get dry patches and I have an oily t-zone. It really just depends on the day. I don\u2019t really get bad acne and I don\u2019t have sensitive skin so I don\u2019t know if the effects would be the same! But I would absolutely advise giving it a try. Also something I had not read about when I looked this mask up was that as soon as you put it on it does get very very itchy as the bubbles begin to form and pop. My boyfriend couldn\u2019t stand the feeling but I didn\u2019t mind it, and found that I got used to it after a minute or so. So if you have a thing with being sensitive to weird feelings you may not like this.",

You use the tiny paddle thing it comes with to smear it on your face. It feels a little cold going on and applies pretty easy. It really doesn't take much. I've used it twice and have used maybe 1/4 of it. You leave it on for 5 minutes as it foams up. It tingles and kinda itches, not in a bad way. Then you add water and massage for 2 minutes, this can get a little messy. Then you wash it off. It takes some time to get it all off. I've found it's easier to do it before you take a shower and just wash it off in the shower. It leaves my skin feeling smooth, soft and clean but not too dry. I think it helps reduce the redness a little. Overall, a fun/different face mask that really cleans and softens my skin without over-drying or giving me a rash.",

There's no way to describe it, but even dry it feels.... slick, like an oil base does, but it's not oily at all. I couldn't take it off at the sink, I needed a shower, and a washcloth.

I just finished washing it off my face and I have to say I do see a difference, albeit not a dramatic one. I have enlarged pores in my t-zone and issues with blackheads around my chin and after one use my pores appear smaller and tighter and most of the smallest blackheads and bumps are gone from around my chin. I was impressed, but I think with regular use it might make an even bigger difference - maybe a couple times a week. Oh yeah - it's also really fun to watch and feel the bubbles foaming up on your face! A couple notes: 1. I wore vinyl gloves and used the included spatula to apply the mask to try to avoid contaminating the rest of the product. 2. It was harder to wash off than I expected. The foam forms on the surface of the mask, but underneath it's still thick and creamy. I used a washcloth to help ensure I removed it thoroughly. 3. You'll likely want to use a moisturizer after having washed off the mask as it leaves your skin feeling a little tight.",

Because I do not know how to read the directions... They are not in English... Put the mask on, DO NOT USE YOUR FINGERS WHEN TOUCHING THE CONTENTS IN THE CONTAINER. The clay reacts to water, oil and air! So if you'd like to keep the clay in the container from foaming and turning into a moldy cloud, reduce exposure to these elements. The package comes with a little plastic applique. Use that when scooping out the clay from the container and if you'd like to, then use your fingers to spread it around on your face. Let the clay foam up, for about 5-7 min then rub the clay foam around on your face to really loosen up the oil and dirt. Let it rest for about another 5-7 min. It will foam up again, but not as drastically. Then rinse. I'm not a huge mask person, but I have to say it's fun and did leave my face softer and tighter. I looked like a cloud!!!!",

            "review_text": "*I bought this product without a discount code and my opinions are my own *PACKAGING* I wasn't expecting much for a face mask so cheap, but after trying I have no regrets! The packaging keeps the mask sealed, so it doesn't carbonate inside the container. After unscrewing the lid, there is a removable hard plastic covering which holds a small applicator, but I ended up not using it because I had a better one. *ACTUAL MASK* The mask itself has the slightest scent, almost like a flowery one that you would find in a lotion. I have normal to oily skin, so it didn't affect me, but if you have sensitive skin be careful, and try some on your wrist before putting it on your face. Again, the scent is barely noticeable. It is creamy and thick, but not too difficult to apply. It carbonates after around 30 sec (depending on how much product you use) so I had to hurry while putting it on. It bubbles up for a while, so wait 10-15 minutes before taking it off, again, depending on how much product you use. *REMOVAL* Taking it off was a bit of a hassle because it was so thick. I first tried using my hands and water, but that just slid around the product. I ended up just using a washcloth, which worked fine. *SKIN BENEFITS* The product is supposed to close pores and remove blackheads, which it did moderately. I personally don't have large/noticeable pores, so I can't say much. It did, however, clear away some blackheads. *SUMMARY* All in all, I think this product is great. The fun factor outways the skin benefits, but it is great to do with friends!",

My face felt really *squeaky* clean immediately after removing the mask, but I had to use a washcloth to help remove the product. This clean feeling was more likely from the exfoliation and intense washing than anything else. It didn't break me out, that's a plus. But that's about it.

I did experiment a little to figure out how much you need to use, and it\u2019s not a lot, but it does need to cover the skin completely. I put it on with a silicone spatula and it starts foaming in just a few seconds. After a minute you look like your face is covered in grey velvet. The instructions say to leave this on for about 5 minutes. To let it work, and it rinses off with warm water.

            "review_text": "I just came back from Asia, where masks are all the rage right now. I brought back a ton of sheet masks, but those get expensive quickly, so I opted for this jar mask, after reading all the good reviews. However, I'm always skeptical of over-the-top glowing reviews (with tons of exclamation points,) especially in the field of skincare, where results are subjective and can vary widely depending on the user. So if you're a fellow skeptic, and you're reading this review, I'll cut to the chase and say that it *does* seem to help pores a little, although I can't say it's any more effective than any other clay mask, used regularly. From my perspective, it absorbs some of the waxy oils (sorry, gross) at the entrance to the pore-- the result is that the gunk becomes very easy to extract, if you are so inclined. Could you accomplish the same thing with literally any other clay mask on a weekly basis? Probably. I don't really think the bubbling is legitimately doing much, aside from being entertaining. The mask has a texture like Jell-O pudding, and is easy to use----smear it on your face, and let it sit for 10 minutes. Once it bubbles up, mush it back down and massage it into your skin like a face wash, then rinse the whole thing off. Skin feels clean and normal afterwards, not dry or squeaky. I read some reviews that made it seem like the bubbles were itchy torture, but they're not. It's a bubble mask, not Guantanamo. It's pleasant, it's reasonably effective, and it's more cost-effective than buying individual bubble sheet masks, so I can see myself repurchasing this when the jar is done. However, I also want to mention that I actually prefer the Elizavecca Kangsi Pack 24K Gold Mask, which does the same thing more or less, but seems to temporarily tighten my pores better. You probably can't go wrong with either one--they both temporarily make your pores less noticeable.",

It is still a great cleanser, leaves the skin soft, and is so much fun to use! Here are a few useful tips: 1. Use the spatula. It keeps you from running the product in the jar because contact with water will make it foam up and disintegrate. No bueno. 2. Spread it in a thin layer. This is very important because the thicker the layer, the harder it is to rinse off and while a thin layer may appear sparse in the beginning, when it foams up, it will expand across the skin. 3. After letting the mask sit for 10-15 minutes, massage the foam into your skin for up to 2 minutes to help stimulate your skin's circulation and get some additional exfoliation action. This also helps to rinse the product off with more ease. 4. Use no more than twice a week. It'll run out quickly if you go over that and a good mask should generate good results with that amount of usage.",

My brother-in-law said I looked like one of the trolls from Frozen, and I must say, the resemblance was uncanny. I left it on for 5-10 minutes, took a multitude of hilarious selfies, then washed it off. If you're in any kind of a hurry, you might hold off on using this stuff until you've got some time to devote to cleanup, because you're gonna need a minute (or 5). After you smoosh down all the bubbles, you'll still have a thick layer of mask to take off, and it doesn't just magically wash away with one splash of water. I'd recommend using a soft washcloth. After I (finally) got it all removed, I was pleasantly surprised by how soft and smooth my skin felt.

This clay mask works really well and leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth. You have to be carefull when applying it and not go overboard because it does bubble up quite a bit. You can even hear them like Rice Krispies in your ear! Make sure to leave some space around the eyes and nostrils so the bubbles don't get in there. After about 5 minutes you can wash it off, and I would recommend using a small towel to help out because it will take a while if you only use your hands and water. It does a good job and is fun to use.",

It did settle after about 10 min but still the longest 10 min of my life lol. Does have a little burning nothing too bad. I must warn this is a very stripping mask so don\u2019t apply anything to face after! I usually use a mud mask which I applied to my nose (didn\u2019t apply this product to) and part of my face where the mud mask got burned like h***! Even putting toner burned. My face did feel very soft after bubble mask. Do recommend if you think you can handle don\u2019t recommend if your face is sensitive.",

It's so fun to watch and makes a fun sound. Then you wash it off, which I've found to be a little difficult. I've started wiping it off with a cloth before actually washing my face with water because it makes it a little easier. It feels like it exfoliates my skin and makes it smoother.

Then I waited for the bubbles, which didn't take long. But if you think it's bubbly at first, wait 10 minutes and it'll REALLY bubble on your face. HOWEVER, as it foams up, it gives the sensation of gentle itches alllll over your face. AND YOU CAN'T SCRATCH IT! Here's where my next issue came: I probably put on too thick of a layer because the top bubbled, but when I went to rinse it off, there was still a lot of unbubbled mask underneath! So I tried rinsing it off and it was really difficult and took a while. Next time, I'll put a thinner layer and see how the bubbling feels, but if it's still agonizingly itchy I probably won't bother again. Maybe that spatula is more helpful for scraping off the excess from your skin rather than applying it.",

There's really not much products, as the containers seems bigger than what is actually inside. But I do enjoy the mask if settling on a fun and carefree day, though I would like something that does not create much of a mess. When applying make sure the skin is dry to have the product adhere to the skin, as I had the mistake of applying when I was in the shower, and it just plops down onto the shower floor and into the drainage T...T I have other versions of wash off masks and they're more easily to wash off and do not create much of a disaster on towels.

I definitely advise to make sure you use the applicator that is provided when applying the mask. Using your fingers (easier, I'm sure!) would risk ruining the product by bringing the oils and moisture of your skin into the rest of the product, thus activating the \"foaming\" effect. Also, wipe your applicator off before placing back on the lid, for this same reason. Keep lid tight to avoid exposure to excess moisture too! I love using this mask! It's so fun and feels great!",

Rub/massage it gently into the face for another two minutes and then rinse off. It is a little hard to rinse off at times but I believe the extra work is worth it. My face feels so clean and soft afterwards! And it smells great too! The carbonation and little bubbles causes my face to tingle and it's such a fun experience (more so than your typical clay mask). I use this product once a week but I believe that it's gentle enough to use 2-3 times per week. As someone who gets the occasional breakout, I'm noticing a difference in my skin! Less breakouts, smaller pores and when I do breakout, it's small and not so large and noticeable. Overall a wonderful product.",

The instructions say to leave it on for five minutes, which I did, after applying to my whole face. I was so pleasantly surprised--none of my usual irritation, my face didn't get red or blotchy at all! I know other people have mentioned that it's itchy, but I didn't think it was that bad. It tingled in the same way bubble bath bubbles or foam soap will tingle--the bubbles popping on your skin are gently tickling you. I found it to be a really nice sensation, and afterward all of my blackheads were gone! I have combination skin, my cheeks get super dry but I have a pretty oily T-zone, and I was really happy that my cheeks didn't feel tight or dried out.

Pores unclogged and skin baby soft. I use products more expensive than this little jar but it achieved and exceed those same results! So impressed. My skin is oily t-zone and super sensitive. Did not overly dry my skin or irritate at all!!",

This is probably the most fun I've had with a face mask EVER, and it's such a good laugh when I put it on with my friends. It leaves my face so soft and bright after every use and the price is so worth it! It does tickle a little and you can actually hear it start fizzing up. The mask \"activates\" and starts bubbling really quickly after you place it on your face with the little spatula tool that comes with the jar, so try to apply it to your face as fast as you can. This mask is great to do 2-3 times a week because it's not very harsh and good for sensitive skin! It takes some patience to remove and wash off though because it kind of reminds me of a soapy material. Overall, this mask is great for a thorough cleanse. I feel like I just went to the spa and got a facial after this every time!",

The bubbling and foaming action really gives you the feeling that your pores are being cleaned. Beware, do not put it under your nose because it will tickle and itch and it will take away from the experience. I recommend spreading this on your face quickly, because the bubbling is instant. I also read that you can press down the bubbles and further massage your face (which also felt very good) for a deeper cleaning. Rinsing took a little longer than I expected because the product builds a lather. But the end result is so worth it. My face felt so clean and fresh and smooth! I felt like my face could breathe! This is definitely an alternative to those harsher facial scrubs. FYI - you get slight redness after you wash this off, but it doesn't last too long.",

It gets a bIt itchy after like 5 minutes of having it on, but you just need to resist the urge. I truly recommend it! The only negative I would have to say is that it takes forever to wash off.

Scoop a quarter size amount and use the spatula to spread it quickly on your clean face, concentrating on your t zone or trouble spots. The clay will start to bubble and foam on your face. Be careful to not put any close to your nostril, you WILL get some bubbles go IN your nares. It has a slight weird smell to it that I can deal with but can see may not be tolerated too well by others. My last picture shows the clay drying up, I find that if I leave it on too long past this point, it is harder for me to wash the clay off my face. I end up with chunks of clay I have to rub off my face. You will be able to feel the softness of your skin as you wash the mask off and my pores and blackheads are noticably less visible as well. I like this better than your typical clay masks since it takes less work to wash off all the clay.

We were laughing the whole time because it felt ticklish and we could actually hear it bubbling up. Then we spent 2 mins rubbing our faces to spread the mask. We took about 10-15 mins rinsing it off because it could stick to your skin. However, it was all worth it. Our faces became smoother and the smell is still there. I apply it about once a week because some reviews said it can make your skin really dry. It made my friend's skin dry, but not mine. After 3 weeks, I noticed that my blackheads decreased.

Then let it sit and the bubbles start to form. Your face may feel ticklish because the bubbles are forming and popping. After 5 mins or so, wet your fingers and rub your face in circular motions to re hydrate and work in the clay mask again. Then wash it off and you're done. The clay does take a little more time to wash off completely than a typical cleanser. The results I received made my skin look brighter and my pores smaller. I use this about once a week.",

But be warned: the tickling sensation is a lot more uncomfortable than I thought it would be. I'm particularly ticklish, so use it at your own discretion. The sensation disappears after you rub the product in as directed. Do know that after you rub it in, the product will bubble up again if exposed to air for a period of time. It's different from other masks, and I definitely recommend it for people who want to try something different and refreshing in their skin care routine!",

I still had questions, so I went on YouTube. So I started with a dry, clean face and only took out a small amount of product that I was using so I wouldn't expose the rest to air. I actually liked the included spatula, and I think it worked well. It was a unique feeling. After it went on, it did start to bubble quickly, so application should be on the faster side. It tickle/itches almost unbearably, but the sensation only lasts a few minutes. The second bubbling sensation is quite nice, and I really could have sat around all day with it on my face... If my face wasn't purple and I didn't have to go to work today. I had it on about 10 minutes. I did rub it in at the end with my fingers. I'm not sure this did anything but make the removal process a tad easier. It took a long time to rinse off. And it tastes horrible, so heed my warning and avoid your lips during the rinse process. After drying my face I had two thoughts. 1. Hey, good, my skin did not get dyed purple. This kind of was a fleeting worry I had throughout the experience. 2. My skin is so soft. I didn't even need to follow up with moisturizer, which is unheard of in my world. So now it's roughly 20 minutes past mask usage. Skin still feels great, but I'm thinking of putting on some moisturizer at this point. Bottom line: Can't wait to use it again! I'm also going to put it on hubby to giggle as he tickles uncontrollably!!",

Now, it was really fun, but it also left my face feeling soft and you could see a difference in my face. My skin looked healthier, felt healthier. I did put moisturizer on after because I live in the northeast and right now it's dry and cold and my face is dry, but I don't think I really needed to. This stuff is legit!

I mean really. It's skin care and entertainment all in one. You do have to be careful to close the plastic lid as soon as possible to keep the air out. I like to put it on about 10 min before my shower, get in, pat down the bubbles while still leaving the mask on, and rinse off the mask at the end of my shower. I follow up with moisturizer immediately after. I have recommended this mask to friends and will be purchasing again in the future. PS: As other reviewers have said, it can tickle quite a bit!! Make sure to go easy around the nose, lips, and eyes.",

            "review_text": "I absolutely love this mask. I used it for the second time tonight as an addition to my 10 step skin care routine. As it was bubbling up, I noticed that it was really cleaning my pores. After it completely enveloped my face in gray bubbles, I rubbed in the product a bit more, let it sit for another minute, and rinsed off. Make sure you really rinse it! I had some left over on my chin that I had missed, and it stung from being on there a bit too long. There are so many gimmicky face masks out there that claim to really clean your pores and I swear that I've tried them all. But this one? This one truly works. The proof is in the fact that 99% of the sebum on my nose is gone, and that a couple of stubborn blackheads on my chin came to the surface after rinsing it off. They were easy to extract and hopefully I can get more blackheads removed in the future from using the mask. The only advice I'll give you is: If you have sensitive skin, this mask stings just a bit. I think using it once or twice a week would be ideal, but DEFINITELY NOT every day! Elizavecca products have yet to disappoint me and my skin care routine has a lot of EV products in it. :)",

Try not to apply too much because then it will take longer to all bubble and you will have to deal with the weird sensation of it bubbling on your skin for longer.

I honestly bought it because I thought it would be fun, and enjoyed watching videos about it. The bubbles feel amazing on your skin, and feel refreshing. Just an FYI, a little goes a long way, so you don't need to glob a lot on at first. Also a helpful tip, the container has a cardboard like layer under the lid that keeps the product air tight, get the amount of product you want out and then over it back up ASAP. The air activates the carbonization, and it will ruin your jar of unused product if you don't keep it covered. ENJOY!",

While it was fun to watch the mask bubble and foam, the novelty quickly wore off after posting a few selfies to social media. My first disappointment was that there are no included instructions... at least not in English. The mask is difficult to apply without ruining the entire batch; you must remove a portion with a clean utensil and avoid the mask coming into contact with any type of liquid or oil (otherwise it begins the bubbling process). No double dipping! Likewise, it's difficult to tell how much of the product to use, because there is no way of knowing how much the mask will foam until it's already on skin. Once the foaming is finished and it's time to wash off the mask, rubbing it in isn't the most pleasant sensation. The mask becomes an incredibly odd texture and it takes a bit of effort to remove it. The mask DOES leave one's face SQUEAKY CLEAN (literally!) but it can be occasionally drying or irritating. I wouldn't recommend this for someone with dry or sensitive skin; it was almost too much for my combination/oily skin. I'd only recommend this to someone whose skin is truly oily, or someone who really needs a deep-clean.",

The mask seems like it reacts w the oils in the skin because it started bubbling on their face faster than mine.

I almost prefer using this on lazy mornings because it makes a great flawless 'lit from within' base for makeup.

Though I haven't steadily used it weekly per se; it's rather a hassle to wash off so even though it's fun to see it bubble, I haven't been drawn to use it very often. So maybe if you use it more regularly it's more effective. It does tingle, but tickles primarily. I haveto fight the urge to itch my face. Also little goes a long way don't use too much or it'll get overly bubbly which may give you a laugh but you may regret when it takes you 5 minutes to wash off. I think it works better when a thinner layer is massaged in anyway. Also while you're massaging in, especially if you're slow paced, try not to leave the container open to air long.

I even wiped away the bubbles into the sink... And another layer of the mask was under! And it bubbled some more!! I finally wanted to wash it off and it became the consistency of thick shaving cream (and continued to react)... It was a hell of a time washing it off LOL... SO MUCH CARBONATION! I think next time, I'm going to put a thinner coat... It'll make things a lot easier. Tips: Keep the layer thin Leave a large area around your eyes (it will bubble up and get on your eyelashes!!!)

Not so horribly it was excruciating, but enough to make it uncomfortable. It also didn't get as bubbly as I'd hoped, which was a bit disappointing. It irritated my skin and around my cheeks and nose it felt sunburned. Maybe I put it on wrong, maybe I applied too much, I don't know. I might try it again at some point and see if I have a different experience. EDIT: It's been a couple hours since I've washed off the mask and the redness has subsided and my skin feels SO SOFT, I can't stop touching it lol.

This is my first ever review and, to be honest, I never planned on writing one for anything, but then this little gem of a product came into my life, and now I have different priorities. This stuff is AMAZING. Firstly, it's just fun. The bubbles tickle your face, and after about five minutes become so large that your face looks like a cloud. I take this stuff with me to sleepovers, and make all of my friends try it, and it's a big crowd pleaser. Secondly, and most importantly, it does wonders for my skin!!! I wasn't expecting that. Yesterday my face had uneven redness around my chin, several small pimples trying to make an appearance, and overall blotchiness. I then put some of this on, waited about fifteen minutes, then went to sleep. Then I woke up this morning to a straight up miracle! My skin tone is even, and my pimples are much, much less noticeable. What kind of magic is this?!?!",

This stuff does tickle a heck of a lot while it works, which is also kinda fun. My face was clean afterwards, but not remarkably smooth or moisturized.

It does when the mask is bubbling up tickle, so doing this with friends is fun because you can laugh with each other. Do not put the mask too close to the mouth, nose, eyes or when the mask expands it will enter the areas and make it hard to see\\breath. Once the mask has bubbled for 6 minutes just massage your face and it goes back to its original texture; after that remove the mask. (I recommend using the mask directly before taking a bath\\shower) that way you feel cleaner after taking the mask off. I wouldn't say it's extremely difficult, just can get a little tedious. Someone mentioned that this brand is also cruelty free; I couldn't find any more information about it but that is something to also be happy about while using it.

Even then I liked it! I was really surprised when the mask started foaming almost immediately. I left it on for about 5-8 minutes; the foam was tickling my nose and I couldn't help myself. I recommend using a medium layer--I put it a little to thick on my cheeks and had some trouble rinsing it off. My skin felt so soft--I didn't even have to use a moisturizer after I rinsed. Giving note to all the other users who have large pores like I do--this will enlarge your pores for a bit. Even my boyfriend noticed that mine had distended a bit a few hours after I used it. They shrank back to a normal size by the next morning, but I won't be using this regularly because of that affect.",

Another bonus, my skin was left very rosy and glowy which I don't usually get from peel off masks. I like how bright, firm, clean, AND soft this product makes my skin feel. This mask is more than a trend - by far. I will be reordering when I run out. Oh! And this mask smells AMAZING!

If you don't put it on thin the bubbles will eventually grow out so large that it will close around your nostrils and then your lips and eyes. So be careful! 2.

The scent is light, and I didn't have any \"instant\" bubbling once applied to the skin, it took a while (which was nice, made application less messy). Overall I really like this product!

After the first use, you might think little goes a long way, but it doesn't. Good for an one-time purchase to see what all the commotion is about, but wouldn't purchase again.",

I totally get that it's not an American made product, but if you're going to sell to other countries, at least put instructions in the package with the language. So I had to turn to Google to figure out how to use it properly. Don't get me wrong, Google was helpful, but you don't really know if you're getting 'what worked' for one person, as opposed to the actual instruction. 2. It burned my face! I I do not have sensitive skin at all, so I was surprised when the sensation went from the typical tingling/tickle of the bubbles to full on 'OMG I have to take this off immediately!'. All in all, I'm actually being a little generous with the 3 stars. I've used the product twice now, with the same results. I will probably toss the almost full container and try another product.",

While the initial use is a bit messy compared to your average clay mask (I'm a big fan of Origins Clay Masks and don't find it falls off or cakes. The Milky Piggy did have a little bit of fall away product when it reached maximum bubble), the results - I think - are better with the Milky Piggy mask. My skin felt soft and supple after using it, and not at all dry. Will repurchase again.",

Especially if you moisturize afterwards, your skin feels great. It is incredibly messy to wash off, but if you are careful then it won't be an issue. Also, most clay masks smell horrific, but this one has the most pleasant herbal flowery type scent. I only use this mask once a week, but each time it is great. One thing to take into consideration, don't use it when you have a cold like I did. When it gets itchy, and your nose is running... it is absolute hell and you will wash it off within two min.

I do recommend for first time users to keep it away from the underside of your nose because of the ticklish carbonation. Getting it close to your nostrils when it's clay and then it blowing up to a cloud, it tends to go a little inside your nose and tickles like mad!

However, the smell of it was overwhelming to me (like a fake perfume ingredient, not a natural ingredient). As it sat on my skin, my skin started to burn. I tried to wait the five minutes, but couldn't. The coating it leaves after you rub the bubbles down (as recommended) was difficult to wash off. Since my face was burning so much, washing it off felt like it was taking forever. After getting it off, my skin did feel soft, but I had a neon red flush across my skin like it had given me a chemical burn, and the areas where the rosacea is worse on my face were deep red. I immediately put my soothing toner and hydrating lotion on, but it has been over 30 minutes and my face is still hot to the touch and looks scalded. I have very sensitive and fair skin, and this is a definite no-go for me.

            "review_text": "This product is SO worth the hype! This is exactly what it claims, a bubble clay mask. When opening the product there is a little spatula that comes with the mask. It was a little difficult for me to apply the product with the spatula, so in the future I will probably use a mask brush when applying. I made the mistake of putting on a thick layer, which I believe you only need a thin layer for this product to work or the removal will be a little time consuming. When it is first applied it appears to look like a clay mask. As you let it sit, it begins to foam and bubble up, which is super fun to watch. It does tickle a little bit while it is foaming, but nothing that would make me want to wash it off. I believe I left mine on for about five minutes. The directions say 3-5 but you could leave it on longer and it would be okay. This part threw me off a bit, but it wasn't a bad thing: I figured since it bubbled up and turned into foam, that it would remove like a foaming cleanser. I was wrong! You are supposed to manipulate the mask a bit after you let it foam up, and to my surprise it was still clay like under all of the bubbles. Once you manipulate and massage the mask the foam dissolves and you are back to your clay mask. This is where it gets to be a little annoying if you gobbed the mask on like I did. If you accidentally put on too much, I would suggest removing with a damp, hot towel. If you put on a thinner amount, you should be okay removing it with either a cotton pad or just water and your hands. My skin felt soooooo soft and looked brighter after using this mask. The next morning I noticed that a spot I have healing had decreased in redness by 50% - I'm not sure if it was this mask, or a combination of my skincare routine, but I am so satisfied. I would recommend this product to literally everyone!",

Then you press it back into your skin and it will puff up again . Then massage it off of your skin and wash with a moist towel . It's actually meant to be a makeup remover as well. It suggests you apply the mask with makeup still on . The carbonation melts the makeup away ! Such a great product . And it's an excellent and inexpensive gift .",

I notice once you start to massage your face after it had bubbles for 5 minutes, it seem like there were a lot of products on my face for such a little amount that I put on. They should redirect to once you massage the face for two minutes, wash it off with a warm cloth instead of hand. It took me 5 plus min to wash the clay off.

            "review_text": "I just bought this mask because a lot of my favorite youtubers featured and recommended it for oily skin especially. It was definitely worth the buy because my skin feels super clean and soft afterward. It removed a lot of the excess sebum and impurities without stripping all the skin's natural oils. Pros: -Fun mask due to the bubbles -Leaves skin clean and soft, good for oily/combo skin -Short time compared to other masks (minimum is 5, but you can go up to 10 if you want) Cons: -Tingling or burning may occur depending on your skin sensitivity -Bubbles might be a bit uncomfortable for some people -Might be difficult to remove, see tip below Helpful tip: Put this mask on before you go take a shower. Once you go take a shower, you can wash it off in there with less hassle than struggling to take it off at the bathroom sink. I haven't seen any major differences in skin such as blackheads going bye bye yet, but like any mask that'll take time to see. Would definitely update, but I still would just recommend for how fun and effective it has been for my oily skin in terms of softness and oil removal at the moment. Also, if you're worried about getting a fake (since a lot of foreign products can be.counterfeit), you can check by first looking if the box has a Elizavecca Original sticker, scratch the foil for the QR #, and verifying on the Elizavecca website through the QR code link. And if ingredients is a concern, Memebox is the best source since it lists the ingredients in English. Update: After using this mask consistently and now on my second tub, I can say that it definitely helped in clearing my oily/now a bit more combo skin. My skin is still soft and clean after each use, and in fact my pores reduced in size! Slowly but surely. My blackheads are mostly gone too (90% with just a little on my nose). I still recommend this product after almost a year of use. Finally to note, it seems that Elizavecca updated their box packaging a bit as my second tub now has instructions and ingredients in English.",

Just the amount that was on the cover I lifted off of the jar was more than enough, meaning this will last me a while. It bubbles pretty quickly, and continues to bubble and expand throughout the 5 minutes and kind of tickles! After the 5 minutes I wet my hands and massaged it into my face again for a couple minutes and left it on for another 2 minutes before washing it off. It was a bit hard to wash it off, however, and took a bit of time to get it all off my face. Afterwards, my skin feels really soft and nice. Second day update: This morning when I woke up before work, my face was more moisturized and plump feeling, and this was the only thing I did differently. Recently, I've been breaking out a bit, and I never usually suffer from pimples or acne. Today the new pimples I've recently been struggling to get rid of are significantly smaller in size and look like they're on their way off my face. I don't know if the mask is what helped with this, but it did happen the day after using the mask. Also just from how soft and nice my skin feels after this mask, I'm really happy with this product.",

I'm super-duper oily in my T-zone and dry on my cheeks with a ton of blackheads on my nose. This mask caused me no irritation or discomfort, it does tickle and feel like there's bugs running around on your face. I did not see significant improvement in my skin after the first use but my skin was definitely much softer and clean. For the price it is a great buy and I would say this is definitely my 2nd favorite mask. (My first favorite costs $60 though...) This comes with the product in a plastic jar with a little putty spoon in the lid. I first used my sensitive skin formula face wash and patted my face dry. I then used the putty-spoon to apply this to my face focusing first on my T zone. It began bubbling and fizzing up immediately as it touched my skin, but not while on the spoon or in the jar which was really cool. I let it sit for like 5-6 minutes and it literally bubbled up from probably a centimeter off my skin to about an inch! Be careful putting this around your nose and eyes because it gets big. I rubbed it back in and let it sit for another minute before rinsing it off. I was surprised at how easily it rinsed off the skin. Overall I loved this product and it definitely makes your skin softer and cleanses. I used a biore strip after using this mask and pulled nothing off my face. It's definitely worth the buy, if not for the cleansing power than for the experience of using a carbonated face mask.",

I've heard a lot about this bubble clay mask from other people and on-line and I saw it at local Korean cosmetic shops. The cost to buy from local shops is way more expansive than buying it on Amazon. I decided to give it a try since it is relatively cheap on Amazon and it has prime shipping. I had no idea what to expect the first time I used it. I used the plastic spatula included to scoop out a quarter size amount. Then I used my fingers to spread it across my face. As soon as the mask touch my face it started to bubble and foam very quickly. Before I could finish covering my entire face, the part of my face that was covered earlier has already completely foamed up. So, you have to work very quickly. The second time I used it, I worked much faster and it was okay. I noticed my skin appears smoother after use. Some reviewer said their pores seems to shrink but I have to say I haven't noticed significant change in pore size. Maybe I haven't use it enough to notice a difference yet. I do feel like the mask pulls out the dirt in my poles and my face feels fresh and clean after using it. Overall, I would recommend this bubble clay mask.",

I'm not sure if it's because I applied too much product on my face- but when it started to tingle and tickle my face, it was soo annoying. I couldn't stand the feeling. My entire face felt itchy. I normally wouldn't classify my skin as sensitive, but I couldn't handle the tingling sensation on my face. It felt like I had spiders crawling all over.

My sister put on a much thicker layer and when the mask bubbled, it looked so horrifying! When it came time to washing the mask off, that was a bit difficult. I had to wash a few times to really get everything off. My sister had a much harder time because she had more on. After washing it off, my face felt nice and soft. However, my sister says the mask is too dehydrating for her. She says her face felt too dry after using the mask. Not sure if it's because she used more of the it than I did. My skin type is normal and my sister's is combination with oily T zone and normal elsewhere. *** Update 2/5/2017 *** One tip to easily get the mask off the face is to wash it off with a face towel.

The consistency of the clay is very smooth. It kind of reminded me of cake frosting. Almost immediately after applying it to my face it started to foam up. And it continued to foam up the longer I kept it on my face, which was very amusing. After a few minutes, I rubbed the foamy clay all over until it resembled a normal clay mask and then waited another few minutes. I could still feel it fizzing on my skin which felt tingly. After I finally washed it off, my skin felt firmer and very refreshed. I just started using this so I'm not sure of the long-term results, but I'll be sure to update my review if anything changes. So far I definitely recommend. This would be a lot of fun at sleepovers.",

It is a mild mask even though it has a menthol-like sensation. The product is a grey clay mask that bubbles up once it is applied on the skin. It feels fresh and tingly on the skin... the clay should draw out impurities from the skin. But I have found that it does not really dry up on the skin. The instructions are in another language, so my different occasions of using this mask I have tried different things such as leaving it on for different amounts of time. It just does not dry hard. I have also tried smoothing the mask back into my face after it had bubbled up- that does not seem to make a difference in performance. Removal of the Elizavecca Piggy Carbonated Bubble Clay mask takes some work. I find it easiest to remove it while showering- lots of water and rubbing. Conclusion: I have used it a few times and shared the product with friends... along with taking photos to share the puffy face. After using the product my skin is left feeling velvety soft, it is nice, but I do not think there is any other benefit... no pore tightening, no deep cleansing of pores or drawing out impurities, no reducing the size of my pimples, no exfoliation, no hydration.",

Note that this mask suds up like soap. - Lastly pat dry That's it! I do this mask about 1 - 2x a week (: Love it!",

It goes on like a normal clay mask. After about five minutes, this stuff starts to foam up. It's super tingly and really feels like it is penetrating my skin.

To me, this mask is the next generation of clay masks. It not only cleans deeper, but it's also easier to get off than the standard clay packs and it has a nice warming feel on the face. Caolin also makes a nice one, but this review isn't about that. Don't be thrown off by the packaging, if you aren't feeling it - I'm normally a more elegant packaging girl myself - but because this stuff really does work, I'm keeping it.

My fifteen year-old daughter heard about it (we're both recent converts to the wonders of Korean skin routines) and we decided to try it, if only to be able to say we owned a facial product called \"Milky Piggy\". We usually use clay masks to purify and de-oil our skin. This works better and you get a good laugh to boot. It comes with a little spatula. Use it. If you stick your fingers in this stuff, it starts the foaming process in the jar, which is not what you want. Scoop some out, spread it all over your face and feel the sparkly party begin. Wait for 8 minutes and try not to scratch or sneeze (it tickles!). Your face will feel like it has ginger ale bubbles all over it. Pretty soon you will have a smooth, thick layer of foam on your face that makes your features look lumpy and misshapen. While you're waiting for the 8 minutes to end, go leap out at someone and scare the pants off them. I recommend washing this off in the shower. Especially if you're fifteen and splashy at the sink. It's gray and foamy and it doesn't just wipe off. You put a little water on your face and massage the mask into a creamy consistency and then gently wipe with fingers and more water until it's gone. It may take a bit, so be patient. Your face will be soft and clean and all the crud in your pores will be under siege. Plus you just had the most fun at-home facial ever!",

Once your whole face is fluffy (it does not run) you pat the bubbles down and let it sit a little longer before washing off. Thankfully it does not leave your skin feeling weird or stripped. Pros: -There is a LOT in this little tub. -It comes with a spatula that fits inside the cap. Super sanitary! -It's fun. Honestly. Bubbles on your face? Yes. -Leaves skin clear and feeling lovely Cons: -Long shipping time. :( I wish it was exfoliating as well, but that's personal preference. Overall, it was a great buy and I would buy again.",

It's recommended to leave it on for 5 minutes which is kind of difficult since you want to scratch so badly the entire time. However, even with the itchiness I would still give this a solid 5 stars. Overall we are very happy with this product and would definetet buy it again!",

Plus the whole mask only takes about 5 minutes so it is perfect for someone who wants a little pampering but doesn't have a ton of time to waste. I love it! I love the foaming action it gives and it left my skin feeling super soft and incredibly clean. I even went the next day without makeup and had three different people (which is a lot for me seeing as I work in a small office) comment on how great my skin looked! Buy this stuff, use it, love it, throw all your other masks away. Pro tip: at the end of the 5 minute bubbling time, rub the mask in with your fingers, kinda like you would normally wash your face. This helps it become a little more effective and really delivers a final \"push\" to get all the dirt and grime off your face. Hope y'all enjoy!",

The product inside was sort of green-hued (not the blue/grey I originally had). It took a half hour to \"kind of\" bubble up when I finally got up the nerve to test it. My skin hadn't changed.

I used the spatula to quickly applythe clay on my face and then massaged a little on face with fingers in circular motion. Kept it for about 20-25 minutes and washed it off with warm water and cold water after. I saw many comments saying it was a hassle to take it out but I didnt have any problem. I figured that was may be cause I didn't use a lot of clay and I also massaged it making it a thinner layer. Anyways, my face felt softer and pored did appear a little smaller. Having super oily skin, I was afraid that in the morning I would have oilyness back again, but suprsingly it was way less oily than it usually is. So, after it really worked. I can't wait to use it every two days at night now.",

I've been looking for a replacement for my favorite mask, Nu Skin's Epoch mask. I always loved it, it's scent free, but it's kinda spendy and it did dry my skin a little. For about the past month I've gone off all migraine prescription meds and have been trying cannabis for my migraines. I have a few methods, but one is a cannabis balm/salve that I can put on my forehead and temples. It does help. But it's \"fat based\", because that's how your body absorbs cannabinoids, though fat cells. So even though it works, when I have a bad migraine and use it multiple times. It is oily. This made my need to find a new mask product greater! (In unrelated advice, if you're stuck on topamax and imitrex or zomig for migraines, I suggest getting off of it. They cause so many rebound headaches, and those medications aren't good for you. I've noticed so many small changes in my body, skin, hair, and teeth since I got off those meds. Not to mention LESS headaches, I do get migraines but all those medications CAUSE more rebound headaches.) So back to this amazing mask! I am on the other side of a severe 2 day migraine. I got up this morning, feeling better, also looking like I've been to hell and back. I ate breakfast, had some coffee. I used this mask, because like I said my forehead was greasy. I don't want to get clogged pores! My skin looks amazing! It's my second time using this product. My skin is so soft and smooth. Pores teeny. I LOVE that there is a light scent, but it's hardly noticeable. Another brand i tried from amazon \"Deep Sea Mud Mask\" was so scented I couldn't stand it. This happy pig mask doesn't dry my skin out AT ALL. The first time I waited a while to moisturize, because I wanted to see if my skin was dried out. NOPE. No dry flaky looking skin. My only complaint is the directions are in Korean (maybe?!) so I did watch a youtube video to make sure I used it right.",

I originally heard about this product through a Facebook video ad - looked it up on Amazon and with all the amazing reviews and price, what did I have to lose? The container itself is really small - a bit disappointing in size but when applying the clay to my face, I hardly used very much. Probably used a portion size similar to a grape. I think the container could provide around 20-30 uses. As far as the product itself - it starts to bubble pretty quickly after applying so you need to be quick. Once it was applied, I left it on for nearly five minutes as it began to bubble over. One thing I wasn't prepared for was the bubbles slightly tickling the face; kind of makes you want to itch but it's really no big deal. The Facebook video ad I watched, the girl popped all the bubbles by lightly pressing on the them and then massaged the clay on her face to look like a real clay mask (I of coarse did this - also side note, the container and packaging have no english instructions what so ever so the Facebook ad served as great instructions). Massaging the left over clay on my face felt great! Velvety. I left it on for another 3 minutes and then finally washed it off. The clay definitely left my face feeling squeaky clean. All my pores looked clean and most importantly minimized. I tend to be on the slightly oily side in skin (no acne issues - an occasional zit or pimple and a few black heads but that's really just occasional) - after my skin started to dry, it started to feel pretty tight (so slightly drying). I used a thick moisturizer and left my skin alone all day. On my way to bed, I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth and literally took a double take in the mirror wondering if I had applied foundation earlier that day - my skin looked flawless! I occasionally have blemishes under my eyes/cheeks but my skin was completely even! I don't think I have ever used a product that has brought instant and amazing results like this - totally recommend it!!!",

            "review_text": "Putting it on was the worst part, next to taking it off. But that's every clay mask you use. You have this spatula and you're using it to smear the mask on your face, which has the consistency of pudding. I did my nose first because I knew that was the trouble spot, but it was like instant when it started foaming. Then again, it was pretty warm because of the sun when I was walking home with it, so I'll give that the benefit of the doubt. My face feels softer, especially my nose. The sides of my nose aren't as clear as when I use the Bior\u00e9 charcoal face scrub in the shower, though. However, this mask did dry up the acne I did have, so now they're not much trouble :) I used a little too much on my top lip because when it foamed to max capacity it was going in my nose. Don't use too little because it'll just dry and not do anything; use too much and you're a foam monster LOL But like the other scrub, when I took it off (with multiple paper towels), my face was red. Once it was off for a few minutes it was back to normal so nothing to be worried about. Though I was surprised that I felt no burning sensation like I usually do with the other. You may have to wash off your face multiple times to make sure you got it all off; appearances are deceiving and when a part of your face is still sticky you'll know. Overall, I am very pleased with it. It's a fun way to pamper yourself when you're having a bad day and the results make you feel (and look) good :)",

            "review_text": "I LOVE this product! First, it's fun. It's a great product to use if you have your friends staying the night, you're cheering up a girlfriend, or you're bonding with your mom. Everyone gets a kick out of it. It spreads over nicely and immediately starts bubbling up; a little goes a long way with this. It's great with light makeup removal - it's recommended that you use this product with an unwet, uncleansed face. I personally wouldn't use it while you've still got heavy makeup on, but a light cleansing beforehand would be enough; this product will get the rest of the stuff off. Once you apply it, you spread the product over your face, avoiding your eyes, mouth, and I like to avoid my nostrils. The product will begin bubbling almost immediately, but reaches peak bubbling after about 5-10 minutes. Because this product bubbles, it expands past where you initially placed it on your face. For this reason, keep the product further from your eyes/eyelashes than you would with other masks. It's fairly easy to wash off with cool water, but it does take a few minutes since the product doesn't dry completely like other cream masks might. I just stand over the sink or get in the shower afterwards to wash it all off. Makes your skin feel VERY clean and helps tremendously with blackheads and helps my pores a little. Doesn't do anything for deep zits, whiteheads, scarring, etc...So if your problem is big pores and blackheads, this product will be great. It's not harsh, and doesn't leave my face feeling extremely tight like other clay masks. The bubbles DO get a little ticklish/itchy while they're forming. The smell is light and pleasant. It's got a goopy, thick consistency...almost like pudding. A small spatula is included to scoop the product, which is super nice! A topper underneath the lid holds the spatula in place. The packaging is NOT strong - don't drop this container or you might have little grey, bubbly goop everywhere. Store this in a cool place and make sure the lid is securely on after every use - if it's loose or the topper isn't on, it will begin to bubble in the package excessively and you will lose product. Overall, a very fun and quality product for those with pore or blackhead issues.",

I literally look like a grey cloud with this on my face, or that iPhone grey moon emoji in cloud form. Picture worthiness aside, it's a product that works! My skin feels very soft and clean after I wash it off, and I recommend that this product be used before showering so that it's easier to wash off because attempting to wash it off in front of the sink took a while. I really like the spatula it comes with, it helps with applying the product evenly on the face but be sure to apply it a bit away from the nostrils and eyes because it foams up rather high; the first time I used it it blocked my nostrils with how high it foamed and got onto my lashes. Don't forget to massage the product before washing it off, it helps with removing dead skin cells and I've noticed that it re-foams afterwards which theoretically should help with lifting up and off any dead skin cells and other gunk. This product does have a scent but it's pleasant and light, I think it shouldn't be an issue for most people. I have fairly sensitive skin and I haven't experienced any skin issues with this product. Be sure to check on the Elizavecca website if the product you receive is a legit product or not, there's a sticker on the packaging with a scratch off bar that will reveal a code to type in. Their website is a little confusing to navigate and very cluttered, but even with zero knowledge of Korean I was able to find the verification page.",

BUT, it took forever to wash it off my face. Almost like washing your hands with a super slimy soap that you can't get off. It's probably better if you use a face towel. After drying my face, I noticed that not was I left with dry skin, but it was accompanied by micro red bumps on my face. They weren't super red, but definitely noticeable. As fun as it is to use, this is not something that I would ever touch again. This is not to say that it wouldn't work for others. There are many good reviews so give it a try.",

Do not get this anywhere below your nose or near your eyes because it foams up and gets huge. You look like an angry grey cloud and you'll be even more angry if this gets up your nose or in your eyes. It does itch on occasion and that can be super weird to deal with just persevere! Once the mask is done bubbling and looks deflated then you rub it all over your face until it isn't that spreadable. Now here comes the most irritating part: washing it off. Washing this puppy off takes time and work because the second you add water and the whole thing becomes a sticky foaming cleanser. You have to constantly do multiple rounds of rinsing to get this fully off your face but it is so worth it. My skin feels and looks fantastic after using this and the blackheads seem to be completely gone or missing which is great! It's super fun to do with your friends and it works very well!

So this being my first was fun and I couldn't be happier. I had a hard time opening it, but my husband got it open quickly so it could just have been me not knowing how. After putting it on my face right away it starts working so I have to be quick to smooth it on all around my face. The only TIP I have, and again this could just be me because it was my first time, do not put it so close to your eyes. My eyes were kind of burning although nothing got in them. I put the mask too close to my eyes. I could feel it working, my face felt like it was not burning but something was going on. It didn't hurt but it was different. Washing it off took me a while but once I had it off OMG my face felt amazing. I kept making my husband touch it because it was just so smooth. Love this product! Cannot wait to try it again.",

His skin is not sensitive, my skin is and easily gets irritated. I've used this product multiple times and am happy to report, no skin irritation! I do find the smell something I need to get used to. The first time, the smell was overpowering. I tend to use it once every few weeks (mostly because I'm lazy and have other products I love) and I've grown to mostly enjoy the smell. My partner liked the scent right away. After this is a carbonated mask, it does BUBBLE UP. It goes on kind of goopy and then foams up quite fast, in my opinion. BE CAREFUL of your eyes and nose. Foams up enough to intrude those areas if you put it close by. The feeling of it actually bubbling up is ticklish. My partner barely lasted five minutes before he had to wash it off. I lasted to about ten minutes. FUN THING. You can actually rub it back to a smooth consistency AFTER it foams up... and then it will foam back up. After washing off the mask (which can take a minute or two), my skin felt awesome. It had a nice glow to it and felt so smooth and nice. All in all, fun and awesome product. I even purchased one for a gift for my sister. SHE LOVES IT.",

The mask bubbles on your face, but if you have ever used a bubble/carbonated mask before, this one is underwhelming. The best part about carbonated masks is feeling tons of bubbles \"pop\" on your skin, but with this mask you do not feel them. This is a clay mask, so it just feels like the mask is too heavy for you to feel any bubble action. I will say that my skin felt ok after using this product. My pores shrunk a bit and my skin felt tighter, though very dry. It feels like there is a lot of soap/detergent in it. It does a good job at cleansing your face. This is one of those masks that takes forever to wash off (most clay masks do). It gets everywhere and makes a mess. The results are definitely not worth the cleanup.I only gave it three stars because you can't feel the bubbles popping on your skin, and because it was very drying. I just think there are so many better masks out there.",

In what recent study did we find that fizz is good for the skin? Not sure, but I'll admit it's neat when it fluffs out. It scares my husband every time too, so there's that. It doesn't do much else, though. I have very oily skin with large pores and frequent acne, and I didn't find that it made my skin super smooth or anything. It's a pain to put on because it starts bubbling seconds after you start spreading it on your face, it tickles like mad, and it's hard to clean off. If you're someone with bad skin looking for a mask to help, you should look elsewhere. If your skin is nice and you want a fun, different mask once in awhile, then this one is kinda fun.",

Yes it does bubble up faster depending on how oily your face it when applying it. And Yes it does itch alot when it bubbles but after that your face feels so refreshed and clean. I would recommend a face moisturizer if your skin gets to dry because it literally gets rid of all your oils. I work part time at a pizza shop and my face is naturally oily already but with the grease an oils there it makes my face super oily and when I applied it I didnt wash my face so it started working immediately. Its a fast acting mask so when you apply it id say to work slightly faster then with other masks. Also. When you wash it off it is EXTREMELY soapy and you dont wanna get it in your mouth lol it tastes bad. But it does have a nice scent and yes after applying the product some of the product will bibble up in the container but its okay cause its just reacting from the oils on the applicator that you used while dipping it back into the container. Other than that its a great product and I wish I could rate it more than five stars. So I highly recommend it to other people who have oily skin and like a refrest feeling after a face mask. No pain all gain!",

For starters, this mask is REALLY fun to apply. It comes out like a think clay (as the label states) and once exposed to oxygen in the air it starts bubbling up so you do have to apply it really fast before it starts bubbling. Once the mask has completely bubbled you massage it a bit more in the skin and then wash it off. Playing with the bubbles was fun cause I'm a dork haha. This product smells really good too so thats another pro. The only reason why I rated it 4 out of 5 starts is because this mask is supposed to do many things but a few are lightening up dark circles and attacking white/black heads. Its supposed to deep clean and get rid of problem areas on the skin. I felt as if my face was super duper clean after I used it but my black heads/ white heads remained the same and ive used this product many times now and still the same result. So it didn't feel that it did did cleaning but did make my face feel soft like a babies bum and clean at the surface. Overall, this product is so unique and cool and I would buy it again.",

You do get a tingling sensation from the bubbles popping on your skin, but it's nothing bad. It's a little hard to rinse off, and would do so with an exfoliator and warm water for a faster process. My skin felt really hydrated, refreshed and soft afterwards! It's a pretty good size, I use it once a week and I still have plenty left. I use a small amount to create a very thin layer to cover my face, because as it bubbles up it sort of thickens. It's pretty fun to use with friends!",

This way works best for me and my stubborn blackheads because the steam in my shower opens up all the pores and it continues to clean my pores throughout my whole shower. Doing the mask post-shower didn't work for me as well. Also: Much better than the dead sea mask from Pure Body Naturals!",

But it's a very minor inconvenience. However, the performance of this mask has done wonders for me. For about two years, my left cheek suddenly broke out really badly and left me with constant new blemishes and scars (and a terrible lack of confidence), but after using this maybe 3 times a week for about a month, I've noticed and felt such a difference. My pimples and zits have died down, only reappearing after a lazy night every now and then like how it used to be. My cheek is flatter, no more raised bumps and uncomfortable textured makeup. My foundation sits smooth on my improved skin and I'm in love with this mask. If they had this mask in a noncarbonated form, I'd throw all my money at it. I'll definitely be repurchasing regardless, though.",

I used it already and have seen a difference in my skin. No, my acne did not disappear, but much of my redness and some cystic acne did go away! Also, my nose is literally so nice and clean now. Wow. My best friend commented on my skin saying that it looked \"clean\", so I'm pretty sure this mask has done something! Now, please use this mask for no more than 5 minutes and massage it in for 2 minutes, then remove by washing your face. Don't remove it immediately after it bubbles up, that's not how it works. Believe me, if you've read reviews by Korean users, that's exactly how they recommend using it for the product's effectiveness. Individuals who remove it with a washcloth, I mean go ahead, but it's better to remove it by washing it off to prevent further micro exfoliation that causes redness and irritation. It's a great mask overall if you don't mind the feeling of your face being tickled and you wanting to scratch your face. It's worth it and I recommend it! :)",

The only reason for 4 stars is because I felt like it didn't do much for my face in the way of hydration. It didn't dry my face out at all it just didn't add anything extra either. I will order this again once I am out because I do like the deep clean it provides. When applying the mask be mindful of your nostrils and your eyelashes because the foam grows quite a bit and when I blinked I got some on my eyelashes and it tickles the inside of your nose if you aren't careful.",

After I use it, my face is firm and nice but afterwards not much of a difference. It's definitely the kind of mask you put on with friends, not something with lasting benefits.

A little goes a long way, and it does come with an internal lid and plastic spatula for scooping some out. I really love that about Asian beauty products - no sticking your fingers right into the jar here, no indeed. It feels a bit sticky going on, and I actually find it a bit stubborn to remove. I prefer to rinse in the shower versus at the sink, because it just takes a little too much water and elbow grease. As part of a three-step pore cleanse, it's been pretty effective for me; no complaints here. The main reason I give four stars rather than five is how hard it is to rinse off.

And this product is what has convinced me to try even more korean skincare products. I think that it is all in moderation. Once the mask bubbles up, I wait for it to begin to tingle. I rub the bubbles out and then rinse off. It is a bit difficult to rise, like any other clay mask, but plain water works just fine.

I think a little goes a long way, it bubbles pretty thick and once it starts bubbling (which doesn't take very long) it definately expands out too not just up, so the container should last for many uses. Which also makes me love the price! You can buy masks at makeup stores for ten times the price that last for two uses and that's ridiculous.. Also note that when putting this on your face, once you have your scoop make sure to close the lid up again since being exposed to light and air is what makes it wanna start bubbling!

As soon as you start putting it on it starts foaming up on your face. You don't want to leave the lid off your product too long because it will start foaming up in the container. You leave the mask on for 5-10 minutes and let it do its thing. It starts to tickle after a few minutes. After its been on for 5 minutes or more you run it in and run the bubbles away. This turns it back into a clay mask. It will start foaming up again after that but not as much. Then wash the mask off with water. I found jumping in the shower is better because it soaps up while you're washing it off. Afterwards, my skin felt so nice and soft. I use it 2 to 3 times a week. I even got my boyfriend to try it.",

            "review_text": "I have been using this product for about 2 months now. I have rather oily skin and I love charcoal products to begin with. I really love this mask, it is fun and fairly easy to use. I know some reviewers have said that it is a little difficult to rinse off. I usually put it on 5 minutes before I am going to hop in the shower. Once you pat the bubbles down, if you massage the....goop? into your face it will lather up and kind of working into the consistency of face wash, which I find a lot easier to remove. I defiantly find that my face is less oily for several days after using the mask, which I use once a week. I do not have sensitive skin, but I have accidently left this product on my face longer (15 minutes) then the recommended time frame of 5 minutes. (random phone calls with people who wont shut up) my face did start to burn and tingle more then usual, but once I rinsed it off there was no redness or irritation and I went on with me life. I would recommend to anyone with oil skin. and I would / will purchase again!",

Overall, i love how fun and effective this mask is. i recommend it to anyone looking to have fun and stay beautiful at the same time. its also really great to do with kids! i took it to a babysitting gig and they were entertained for most of the night",

So I had a change of heart and decided to share this product knowledge with you all. First of all I'm a beauty product junkie with a capital \"J\" and I've tried almost every mask to drugstore to department store and this little gem is amaze-balls. The mask is from South Korea so there's no English on the packing, INSTRUCTIONS: So put the mask on a clean face, leave on for 15 mins and rinse off (as time passes the mask gets foamy), but it's difficult to rinse off. So I use a clean warm washcloth to soften the mask and then rinse with warm water. After using the mask for the first time last night, my husband actually commented on how he couldn't see my pores and that my face was super-duper soft. Tonight the mask is going on my husband, but he doesn't know it. shhhhhh.....",

It bubbles a LOT, so avoid putting it under your nose, unless you want to snort bubbles. :) It tickles so much and you'll want to wash it off, but don't. This clay mask is very drying, so don't leave it on forever. Maybe wash it off before all the bubbles pop.vIt is somewhat difficult to wash off, so I would recommend doing it in the shower.
