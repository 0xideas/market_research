Whenever you feel something fizzing on your skin, it doesn't mean that \"it's working\", what it really means is that irritation is taking place. The mask is also extremely soapy and hard to wash off, it reminded me of washing laundry detergent off your hands. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if that was precisely how they made it foam - by adding laundry detergent. I suggest you read up on skincare (reputable, scientifically supported sites like beautypedia.com) and stay away from products like these.",
