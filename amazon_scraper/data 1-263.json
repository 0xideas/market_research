Also so much fun to watch it buddy's up, feels like a spa treaatment."

            "review_text": "Regardless of what I am about to say, this is worth the money purely for the novelty of it. I mean, it turns you into a bubble monster, and you cant help but giggle. Very cute packaging. Inside is a little spatula to help put the product on your face. It foams up so quickly both on your face and in the jar that i found my fingers did a better job. Its very thick and gooey, almost like partially dried glue. no noticeable smell, bad or good. I found instructions online that said put it on an uncleaned and dry face, leave it on for 5 minutes then wash it off. I left it on for much longer to see how much it would bubble. It bubbled for the full 10 minutes before I couldn't handle the tickling feeling anymore, and it started to block the air getting to my nose (so in the future, I wouldn't put this on my \"mustache\" area). This mask did not irritate my skin, but what did irritate my skin is taking it off. Remember how I said it is very thick? Yea. So it took several minutes of washing off with a textured towel. it bubbled up (soap like bubbles, not carbonated bubbles) as i was washing it off, which combined with the instructions saying to put it on an unwashed face, point this more in the direction of a cleanser. Because of its cleansing properties, I would call this more of a cleanser than a mask, but either way, it worked. Assuming that i got all the thick goo off of my face, I would call this a pretty good cleanser (though i didn't try it over makeup, to see if that would come off). it did clear out some of my finer pores. I felt that it was kind of drying, so i followed up immediately with a heavy duty night time moisturizer. Tips: for easier removal and application, go with a thin layer all over your face. But, for first time users, go for a nice thick layer for maximum bubbles! 4 stars because it literally has the texture of glue, and i am not a fan of jar-style products, due to air exposure, bacteria, and higher likelihood of drying out before you finish using the product. Sadly, this is far too thick to even think about putting it into a dispenser. But, this does not kill the joy!"

I prefer to use my fingers because the scooper it comes with is kind of awkward. It starts to bubble quickly. Leave it on for 10 minutes and then rub it around your face. The slightly irritating part of this is taking it off. After a few uses I have found using a wet warm washcloth to remove the majority of it works the best (it doesn\u2019t stain at all) and then rinse any remaining residue off with water. I say this because it is a very thick product and kind of slippery I guess would be the word, so its kind of difficult to get off with wet slippery hands. Another word of caution it is carbonated. I know it says it on the bottle but I just didnt really think about it and was pretty surprised by the reaction on my face. Tiny little bubbles popping and can get sort of irritating, and sometimes you REALLY want to rub your face. It is not unbearable and worth it. This stuff works miracles on my black heads, and my skin feels awesome. I will say that I definitely feel like I need to moisturize afterwards but you should anyway. Sometimes I uses a moisturizer sheet mask after and with the two combined my face feels amazing. Also, it\u2019s fun!"

Even though the instructions state to put it on a dirty face, I would recommend a cleansing before hand because like i stated this doesn't get into pores very well. I have big pores and intentionally made my face very dirty. On a part of my cheek I put the mask without cleansing, on another part I cleaned first, then put the mask on. After the routine of the mask I rinsed it off and my face was noticeably smoother on the side I cleaned FIRST. This is a unique product but I've definitely used better masks."

I hop in the shower, and I even use my clarisonic to really work it in, and it bubbles again! Like getting two uses out of one mask! It's easy to rinse off and leaves skin feeling extremely clean. My face is super smooth for at least two days after using it. I have large pores with lots of black heads and sebum (attractive IKR?) and this definitely reduces the amount of visible black heads and I feel less oily. Great product! Great price!"

But, I didn't feel compelled to buy it until I saw an Amazon deal where this was on sale for a low price. I didn't know what to expect from using this, other than it was going to puff up and look like it was eating my face. I was pleasantly surprised by the borderline tingling sensation on my skin, as the mask reacted with the oils in my skin and bubbled up. I did want to see what would happen if I left the mask on longer than the 3-5 minutes on the directions, and went for 10 minutes; it did bubble up a little more, but it wasn't considerably different from the 5 minutes. I would recommend leaving a half-inch to an inch of space beneath your eyes; it did bubble up enough to touch my lower lashes and when I blinked it got onto my top lashes. Also be aware of the product around your nose, that will also bubble up, and you don't want the risk of it going up your nose! So, don't put the clay on your upper lip (I didn't, because breathing is important!). Afterwards, I don't think I've perfected the process of washing this mask off my face, because it does take a considerable amount of time (and water), but I love how my skin feels."

No more boulder pushing!\" and succumb to your grim fate. I've dealt with blackheads forever. FOREVER. Blackheads are my boulder. Some cures are expensive, or time-consuming, or (in this case) INDESCRIBABLE TORTURE. Strap me to a boulder and let vultures chew out my innards, fine, but do I have to do the mask? In the end, I do apply the mask. It's a few moments of the worst tickle I've ever had the displeasure to endure. Tingling, the description says. Sure, if a million tiny little animals swarming your face is tingling, why not. I literally have to do deep breathing exercises to get through this mask - I have to go to some sort of meditation trance happy place to distance myself from the skin-melting tickle. I've also found squats and lunges to be helpful as a distraction, but sitting still is straight out. (Do be careful not to snort in the mask in a particularly thought-cleansing inhale. You will not enjoy the experience.) And my pores. They're looking better. But at what cost? I'm supposed to be doing the mask right now. Instead, I write this and I wonder... maybe there's a better way to push my boulder. Firmly on the fence. Good luck."

It bubbles almost immediately). -Face felt really moisturized after I rinsed it off. -Short time (the recommended time to leave it on is 5 minutes). Cons: -Messy. Like a few other reviews, I would advise you to use this before you get in the shower. -Tingling sensation is not bad, but I would probably not put this on my chin the next time I used this. It made my want to inch my lips and chin badly. I would probably put a different mask I own on that area. -No immediate results. Very rarely do products have immediate results but I had hoped to notice something. Overall, this is a fun mask, but it's nothing life changing.

I bought it on a whim because I love skin care products and this was so cute and fun I had to try it, especially for the price. So I got it fairly quickly, only took about a week. When I opened it up that night to try it I was in love!!! The container is a decent size (again, especially for the price), I would say there are like 15 applications in there. It was pretty thick so it easily spread on my face in an even layer, it was also very smooth which I love because I often find hat clay masks are gritty. (The little applicator it comes with deserves a review all on itself. I love this touch!! So much easier to apply and much more sanitary, and the fact that it fits right in the jar is awesome, so nice if I ever take it with me on vacation or something) I gave it about 10 minutes even though the package says 5 because I wanted to see if it would keep bubbling (hint: it does) and STILL my skin was radiant after. So clean and smooth but also so so soft! When I woke up the next morning the acne on my chin had completely stopped swelling and dried up, but not the usual gross scabby dry, like a very nice unnoticeable healed skin. The rest of my complexion was noticeably more even, the redness around my nose and on my cheeks had gone down, and again my skin was so soft! I\u2019m absolutely going to keep using this once a week, replacing my regular clay mask. Note: my skin is in between oily and dry. I get dry patches and I have an oily t-zone. It really just depends on the day. I don\u2019t really get bad acne and I don\u2019t have sensitive skin so I don\u2019t know if the effects would be the same! But I would absolutely advise giving it a try. Also something I had not read about when I looked this mask up was that as soon as you put it on it does get very very itchy as the bubbles begin to form and pop. My boyfriend couldn\u2019t stand the feeling but I didn\u2019t mind it, and found that I got used to it after a minute or so. So if you have a thing with being sensitive to weird feelings you may not like this."

Then you add water and massage for 2 minutes, this can get a little messy. Then you wash it off. It takes some time to get it all off. I've found it's easier to do it before you take a shower and just wash it off in the shower. It leaves my skin feeling smooth, soft and clean but not too dry.

I have enlarged pores in my t-zone and issues with blackheads around my chin and after one use my pores appear smaller and tighter and most of the smallest blackheads and bumps are gone from around my chin. I was impressed, but I think with regular use it might make an even bigger difference - maybe a couple times a week. Oh yeah - it's also really fun to watch and feel the bubbles foaming up on your face! A couple notes: 1. I wore vinyl gloves and used the included spatula to apply the mask to try to avoid contaminating the rest of the product. 2. It was harder to wash off than I expected. The foam forms on the surface of the mask, but underneath it's still thick and creamy. I used a washcloth to help ensure I removed it thoroughly. 3. You'll likely want to use a moisturizer after having washed off the mask as it leaves your skin feeling a little tight."

Because I do not know how to read the directions... They are not in English... Put the mask on, DO NOT USE YOUR FINGERS WHEN TOUCHING THE CONTENTS IN THE CONTAINER. The clay reacts to water, oil and air! So if you'd like to keep the clay in the container from foaming and turning into a moldy cloud, reduce exposure to these elements. The package comes with a little plastic applique. Use that when scooping out the clay from the container and if you'd like to, then use your fingers to spread it around on your face. Let the clay foam up, for about 5-7 min then rub the clay foam around on your face to really loosen up the oil and dirt. Let it rest for about another 5-7 min. It will foam up again, but not as drastically. Then rinse. I'm not a huge mask person, but I have to say it's fun and did leave my face softer and tighter. I looked like a cloud!!!!"

            "review_text": "*I bought this product without a discount code and my opinions are my own *PACKAGING* I wasn't expecting much for a face mask so cheap, but after trying I have no regrets! The packaging keeps the mask sealed, so it doesn't carbonate inside the container. After unscrewing the lid, there is a removable hard plastic covering which holds a small applicator, but I ended up not using it because I had a better one. *ACTUAL MASK* The mask itself has the slightest scent, almost like a flowery one that you would find in a lotion. I have normal to oily skin, so it didn't affect me, but if you have sensitive skin be careful, and try some on your wrist before putting it on your face. Again, the scent is barely noticeable. It is creamy and thick, but not too difficult to apply. It carbonates after around 30 sec (depending on how much product you use) so I had to hurry while putting it on. It bubbles up for a while, so wait 10-15 minutes before taking it off, again, depending on how much product you use. *REMOVAL* Taking it off was a bit of a hassle because it was so thick. I first tried using my hands and water, but that just slid around the product. I ended up just using a washcloth, which worked fine. *SKIN BENEFITS* The product is supposed to close pores and remove blackheads, which it did moderately. I personally don't have large/noticeable pores, so I can't say much. It did, however, clear away some blackheads. *SUMMARY* All in all, I think this product is great. The fun factor outways the skin benefits, but it is great to do with friends!"

Use it somewhere one or two times per week because I have another fast peeling mask. It is pleasant, does not have smell, in the jar it looks almost like a jelly (sort of between Popsicle and jelly) of charcoal color (bluish dark grey). I use the amount of less then walnut and bigger then hazel nut - use included spatula. I feel the smooth of my face after using the mask. Not sure about dark nose pores cause I use different things to clean them, but I have the impression that this mask cleans them (may be not significantly - not the WOW, but cleans). I gave 5 for the problem-less of this mask, fast exposition, feelings after using."

I feel like the bubbling is more of a marketing gimmick than the mask showing its effectiveness. After using this about twice a week for a little over a month, I didn't notice any benefits. My face felt really *squeaky* clean immediately after removing the mask, but I had to use a washcloth to help remove the product. This clean feeling was more likely from the exfoliation and intense washing than anything else. It didn't break me out, that's a plus. But that's about it. This would be fun if you have kids, they'd get a kick out of it during a slumber party, etc."

I did experiment a little to figure out how much you need to use, and it\u2019s not a lot, but it does need to cover the skin completely. I put it on with a silicone spatula and it starts foaming in just a few seconds. After a minute you look like your face is covered in grey velvet. The instructions say to leave this on for about 5 minutes. To let it work, and it rinses off with warm water. It leaves your skin extremely clean and I\u2019m finding it definitely seems to clean out even deep into the pores. Definitely keeping this as part of my routine."

            "review_text": "I just came back from Asia, where masks are all the rage right now. I brought back a ton of sheet masks, but those get expensive quickly, so I opted for this jar mask, after reading all the good reviews. However, I'm always skeptical of over-the-top glowing reviews (with tons of exclamation points,) especially in the field of skincare, where results are subjective and can vary widely depending on the user. So if you're a fellow skeptic, and you're reading this review, I'll cut to the chase and say that it *does* seem to help pores a little, although I can't say it's any more effective than any other clay mask, used regularly. From my perspective, it absorbs some of the waxy oils (sorry, gross) at the entrance to the pore-- the result is that the gunk becomes very easy to extract, if you are so inclined. Could you accomplish the same thing with literally any other clay mask on a weekly basis? Probably. I don't really think the bubbling is legitimately doing much, aside from being entertaining. The mask has a texture like Jell-O pudding, and is easy to use----smear it on your face, and let it sit for 10 minutes. Once it bubbles up, mush it back down and massage it into your skin like a face wash, then rinse the whole thing off. Skin feels clean and normal afterwards, not dry or squeaky. I read some reviews that made it seem like the bubbles were itchy torture, but they're not. It's a bubble mask, not Guantanamo. It's pleasant, it's reasonably effective, and it's more cost-effective than buying individual bubble sheet masks, so I can see myself repurchasing this when the jar is done. However, I also want to mention that I actually prefer the Elizavecca Kangsi Pack 24K Gold Mask, which does the same thing more or less, but seems to temporarily tighten my pores better. You probably can't go wrong with either one--they both temporarily make your pores less noticeable."

The acid will eat away a few layers of your skin (gently), but if you're already burnt, it will feel like worse burning. In other news, I'm an idiot. Otherwise great product.

It is still a great cleanser, leaves the skin soft, and is so much fun to use! Here are a few useful tips: 1. Use the spatula. It keeps you from running the product in the jar because contact with water will make it foam up and disintegrate. No bueno. 2. Spread it in a thin layer. This is very important because the thicker the layer, the harder it is to rinse off and while a thin layer may appear sparse in the beginning, when it foams up, it will expand across the skin. 3. After letting the mask sit for 10-15 minutes, massage the foam into your skin for up to 2 minutes to help stimulate your skin's circulation and get some additional exfoliation action. This also helps to rinse the product off with more ease. 4. Use no more than twice a week. It'll run out quickly if you go over that and a good mask should generate good results with that amount of usage."

My brother-in-law said I looked like one of the trolls from Frozen, and I must say, the resemblance was uncanny. I left it on for 5-10 minutes, took a multitude of hilarious selfies, then washed it off. If you're in any kind of a hurry, you might hold off on using this stuff until you've got some time to devote to cleanup, because you're gonna need a minute (or 5). After you smoosh down all the bubbles, you'll still have a thick layer of mask to take off, and it doesn't just magically wash away with one splash of water. I'd recommend using a soft washcloth. After I (finally) got it all removed, I was pleasantly surprised by how soft and smooth my skin felt. I've only used it once, so I don't know if it's best for long-term skin care, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and definitely recommend."

I put the inner lid back into the container and washed off the spatula after each use and I haven't had an issue with it bubbling in the container. There's a good amount of product in the container, and I'm going to get many applications from it. I would definitely repurchase after I use up the masks that I have."

The sensation of the bubbles are weird but in a good way, to me it kinda itched but not in the kind of reaction type but the bubbles really ticked and was making it hard for me to keep it on for the 5 minutes but i was able to. It feels like the bubbles are kissing your pores is how i explain it. The result was great i have very oily and tons of blackheads that doesn't seem to go away but this mask really did make my skin soft and cleared the blackheads. Even the next day my skin was still really soft. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to clear their face in a fun way, i mean who doesnt want bubbles on their face right? Such a funny gift as well. I will for sure be purchasing more for gift. I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbias opinion."

Then massage into face for a few minutes before washing it off. If I'm really breaking out I then use a 100% rose toner from 100 percent pure to reduce inflammation and calm breakouts. Then I finish with Mizon snail repair cream to correct any dark spots or acne scars. If I need makeup I go light just using Colorescience mineral sunscreen (doesn't have SPF so it's the best). Been working like a charm for me. I actually got complements on my skin from Korean people using this routine!

Here's where my next issue came: I probably put on too thick of a layer because the top bubbled, but when I went to rinse it off, there was still a lot of unbubbled mask underneath! So I tried rinsing it off and it was really difficult and took a while. Next time, I'll put a thinner layer and see how the bubbling feels, but if it's still agonizingly itchy I probably won't bother again.

When applying make sure the skin is dry to have the product adhere to the skin, as I had the mistake of applying when I was in the shower, and it just plops down onto the shower floor and into the drainage T...T I have other versions of wash off masks and they're more easily to wash off and do not create much of a disaster on towels.

I will say that it's smart to rinse the included spatula off between applying the mask to your face and getting more product. I would recommend being prepared to quickly apply this product, as I believe keeping it exposed to the air for too long will cause it to lose some of the carbonation that makes the bubble effect. It's rather difficult to wash off in the sink, so I would recommend using this before you get in the shower. Five starts because it was at full bubbley-ness when my roommate got home and I think I scared him."

I definitely advise to make sure you use the applicator that is provided when applying the mask. Using your fingers (easier, I'm sure!) would risk ruining the product by bringing the oils and moisture of your skin into the rest of the product, thus activating the \"foaming\" effect. Also, wipe your applicator off before placing back on the lid, for this same reason. Keep lid tight to avoid exposure to excess moisture too! I love using this mask! It's so fun and feels great!"

Just use a small amount of the mask, spread it on with the little spatula (or use your fingers) and then let it bubble up onto your skin for five minutes. Rub/massage it gently into the face for another two minutes and then rinse off. It is a little hard to rinse off at times but I believe the extra work is worth it. My face feels so clean and soft afterwards! And it smells great too! The carbonation and little bubbles causes my face to tingle and it's such a fun experience (more so than your typical clay mask). I use this product once a week but I believe that it's gentle enough to use 2-3 times per week. As someone who gets the occasional breakout, I'm noticing a difference in my skin! Less breakouts, smaller pores and when I do breakout, it's small and not so large and noticeable. Overall a wonderful product."

However, when I saw this mask on youtube I thought it looked so much fun, and then I saw how inexpensive it was and I couldn't resist giving it a try! The instructions say to leave it on for five minutes, which I did, after applying to my whole face. I was so pleasantly surprised--none of my usual irritation, my face didn't get red or blotchy at all! I know other people have mentioned that it's itchy, but I didn't think it was that bad. It tingled in the same way bubble bath bubbles or foam soap will tingle--the bubbles popping on your skin are gently tickling you. I found it to be a really nice sensation, and afterward all of my blackheads were gone! I have combination skin, my cheeks get super dry but I have a pretty oily T-zone, and I was really happy that my cheeks didn't feel tight or dried out. Overall, if you have sensitive or combination skin, don't be discouraged from giving this product a try! I had such a blast putting it on and snapchatting my friends. I know it says to use it once a week, but I seriously can't wait to use it again."

My only issue is that it made my face kind of dry, but that only has to do with my skin type (combination).

Then I let it sit and bubble for 5 minutes. I then use my hands to rub the bubbles on my face and let that sit for another minute. Then I wash off. It makes my face feel really clean and smooth. I would only recommend using a few times a week though as I think it is kind of harsh on the face if used daily. Also, since this is an Asian beauty product, everything except the name is in a different language. But it's also a really good price for being an Asian beauty item.

This mask is great to do 2-3 times a week because it's not very harsh and good for sensitive skin!

I also read that you can press down the bubbles and further massage your face (which also felt very good) for a deeper cleaning. Rinsing took a little longer than I expected because the product builds a lather. But the end result is so worth it. My face felt so clean and fresh and smooth! I felt like my face could breathe!

But the effects are undeniable, and my sensitive skin doesn't feel the least bit irritated. I think this will be a fun thing to do with kids, too. I may have a contest to see who can keep it on her face the longest... The fragrance is very light and inoffensive--important for a product applied to the face."

At least I couldn't. Made my face raw the first time I used it because I left it on waay to long.) It foams up a lot so you only need a thin layer and it tickles the heck out of your nose. My one gripe is that the smell is a little strong for me. I really wish it was subtler, and even though it goes away as soon as you rinse, it knocks it down a star for me.

Make sure to have something handy to pry open the plastic seal cover that holds the scoop. Scoop a quarter size amount and use the spatula to spread it quickly on your clean face, concentrating on your t zone or trouble spots. The clay will start to bubble and foam on your face. Be careful to not put any close to your nostril, you WILL get some bubbles go IN your nares. It has a slight weird smell to it that I can deal with but can see may not be tolerated too well by others. My last picture shows the clay drying up, I find that if I leave it on too long past this point, it is harder for me to wash the clay off my face. I end up with chunks of clay I have to rub off my face. You will be able to feel the softness of your skin as you wash the mask off and my pores and blackheads are noticably less visible as well. I like this better than your typical clay masks since it takes less work to wash off all the clay. Keep in mind that your skin will feel super dry after this so follow up with your toner, serum and moisturizers!! I've added this to my regimen every other day to keep those black heads at bay..."

We were laughing the whole time because it felt ticklish and we could actually hear it bubbling up. Then we spent 2 mins rubbing our faces to spread the mask. We took about 10-15 mins rinsing it off because it could stick to your skin. However, it was all worth it. Our faces became smoother and the smell is still there. I apply it about once a week because some reviews said it can make your skin really dry. It made my friend's skin dry, but not mine. After 3 weeks, I noticed that my blackheads decreased. I hope it would only take one more use for all of my blackheads to disappear."

Once it starts to bubble on your skin, it gives a nice tingling sensation. For me personally, I didn't keep it on too long as it started to make my face itch.

Definitely try not to sneeze while its on. The foam will spray everywhere. I also had to learn not to get the product too close to my eyes and nostrils. Once it starts foaming, the mask expands (duh); if it's too close to eyes and nostrils... Well, just don't make the same mistake I did and end up wiping it out of your eyelashes or nearly inhaling foam. Overall, I probably won't buy this again because, while its an interesting novelty product and does seem to work reasonably well, it's not what I'm looking for in a mask.

It tickle/itches almost unbearably, but the sensation only lasts a few minutes. The second bubbling sensation is quite nice, and I really could have sat around all day with it on my face... If my face wasn't purple and I didn't have to go to work today. I had it on about 10 minutes. I did rub it in at the end with my fingers. I'm not sure this did anything but make the removal process a tad easier. It took a long time to rinse off. And it tastes horrible, so heed my warning and avoid your lips during the rinse process. After drying my face I had two thoughts. 1. Hey, good, my skin did not get dyed purple. This kind of was a fleeting worry I had throughout the experience. 2. My skin is so soft. I didn't even need to follow up with moisturizer, which is unheard of in my world. So now it's roughly 20 minutes past mask usage. Skin still feels great, but I'm thinking of putting on some moisturizer at this point. Bottom line: Can't wait to use it again! I'm also going to put it on hubby to giggle as he tickles uncontrollably!!"

And it definitely did bubble up as promised, there was just much to be desired. There was no cool tingling feeling some clay masks give. My skin didn\u2019t feel moist or softer after, honestly it felt dried out. With that said the bubbles were cool to look at the first time I used it, but after that they just made me want to itch my face If you\u2019re just looking for the bubbles you can\u2019t go wrong. Although, do make sure your face is completely damp or they won\u2019t bubble (packaging not in English) But if you\u2019re looking for something that is actually good for your skin I would move on"

Makes for a nice trick on you SO if they have never seen it before as the bubbles get pretty big. Down sides is if its too close to your eye sockets it can interfere with you eyesight, but that's it. Totally worth the price, its more expensive on Memebox or other websites I have found. It arrived quickly and without any damage or hassle."

And anyone who says it's difficult to take off clearly does not know how to wash their skin well. You basically treat it like any other face wash - lather it onto your face with water (after about 15-20 min) and it actually will lather off like a regular facial cleanser.

Even after using it multiple days in a row, I'm not having any issues with dryness. My skin feels hydrated and soft. I would absolutely recommend giving this a try! Edit: because the the carbonation, this mask doesn't keep long. I just bought a new container but had a little bit left from the one I purchased a little over a month ago.

I had some left over on my chin that I had missed, and it stung from being on there a bit too long. There are so many gimmicky face masks out there that claim to really clean your pores and I swear that I've tried them all. But this one? This one truly works. The proof is in the fact that 99% of the sebum on my nose is gone, and that a couple of stubborn blackheads on my chin came to the surface after rinsing it off. They were easy to extract and hopefully I can get more blackheads removed in the future from using the mask. The only advice I'll give you is: If you have sensitive skin, this mask stings just a bit. I think using it once or twice a week would be ideal, but DEFINITELY NOT every day! Elizavecca products have yet to disappoint me and my skin care routine has a lot of EV products in it. :)"

I honestly bought it because I thought it would be fun, and enjoyed watching videos about it. The bubbles feel amazing on your skin, and feel refreshing. Just an FYI, a little goes a long way, so you don't need to glob a lot on at first. Also a helpful tip, the container has a cardboard like layer under the lid that keeps the product air tight, get the amount of product you want out and then over it back up ASAP. The air activates the carbonization, and it will ruin your jar of unused product if you don't keep it covered. ENJOY!"

Her skin was brighter and more radiant than I've ever seen it and mt skin mademe contemplate tossing out my makeup and just doing this mask all the time. Our skin is exquisitely soft after just one use and if you're lookingfor some fun bonding time with a niece, daughter, sister or friend this is definitely good for laughs as well.

I wash it off in the shower after letting it steam a bit while I am cleaning. Then on to my second cleanser. Minimizes the mess and the clean up. I use it once a week, because of the fluctuating winter temperatures, I am drying out. I can see the improvement with including a clay/charcoal step during my normal routine, and this makes it easier. No burning, stickiness, irritation to my normal/combination skin. I could definitely see my increasing the use to twice a week during the hot, humid spring/summer months. Definitely a cool way to incorporate a clay and charcoal step to the beauty routine."

While it was fun to watch the mask bubble and foam, the novelty quickly wore off after posting a few selfies to social media. My first disappointment was that there are no included instructions... at least not in English. The mask is difficult to apply without ruining the entire batch; you must remove a portion with a clean utensil and avoid the mask coming into contact with any type of liquid or oil (otherwise it begins the bubbling process). No double dipping! Likewise, it's difficult to tell how much of the product to use, because there is no way of knowing how much the mask will foam until it's already on skin. Once the foaming is finished and it's time to wash off the mask, rubbing it in isn't the most pleasant sensation. The mask becomes an incredibly odd texture and it takes a bit of effort to remove it. The mask DOES leave one's face SQUEAKY CLEAN (literally!) but it can be occasionally drying or irritating. I wouldn't recommend this for someone with dry or sensitive skin; it was almost too much for my combination/oily skin. I'd only recommend this to someone whose skin is truly oily, or someone who really needs a deep-clean."

I wanted to do a pore strip afterwards because it's said to soften sebum, and was disappointed when it barely pulled anything out...

A lot of people complained about no instructions because it's in Korean but this is what I've been doing because I don't know Korean either. I wash my face very well (oil cleanse, then water base cleanser) and before any toner or moisturizer I apply a thin layer of the mask on my slightly damp skin, let it bubble up and leave it on for 20-25 minutes, then I get some warm water lightly move all the foam off and massage in the rest and then I rinse off. My skin is glowing and I will definitely keep buying this! I need a larger container! Lol"

Tip: I didn't put on a real thick layer, I kept it on the thinner side and kept it far enough away from my mouth, nose, and eyes.

Though I haven't steadily used it weekly per se; it's rather a hassle to wash off so even though it's fun to see it bubble, I haven't been drawn to use it very often. So maybe if you use it more regularly it's more effective. It does tingle, but tickles primarily. I haveto fight the urge to itch my face. Also little goes a long way don't use too much or it'll get overly bubbly which may give you a laugh but you may regret when it takes you 5 minutes to wash off. I think it works better when a thinner layer is massaged in anyway. Also while you're massaging in, especially if you're slow paced, try not to leave the container open to air long.

I opened the package and used to the spatula to smear the mask onto my face. It started to react right away! Bubbling away. It continued to bubble for a very very very long time... I even wiped away the bubbles into the sink... And another layer of the mask was under! And it bubbled some more!! I finally wanted to wash it off and it became the consistency of thick shaving cream (and continued to react)... It was a hell of a time washing it off LOL... SO MUCH CARBONATION! I think next time, I'm going to put a thinner coat... It'll make things a lot easier. Tips: Keep the layer thin Leave a large area around your eyes (it will bubble up and get on your eyelashes!!!) Remove the bubbles BEFORE ADDING WATER TO YOUR FACE. (Makes it easier to wash off)"

I did notice that the mask inside the jar started to bubble as well, so I made sure to cap it up quickly. I will say that it does take quite a bit of time when rinsing the mask off-the bottom layer is hard to scrub off and takes a bit of work. My face was nice and fresh feeling and didn't feel dry."

My ideal results were when i used it in the shower. I washed my face, then put the mask on liberally. Let it sit for as long as you can without spraying water on it, then massage (or sonic cleanse, or both!) it into your skin. If you're using a sonic cleaning device or something that rotates or vibrates, be more gentle than you think you should be. Its very foaming, but a little grainy due to the clay. I saw a reduction in oil with the clay, but you use a lot of it for the price tag. Get it for a fun girls night!"

Yesterday my face had uneven redness around my chin, several small pimples trying to make an appearance, and overall blotchiness.

Be aware that this will pull out any impending pimples you might have, so afterwards you might have a few spots that weren't there before, but with regular use it keeps your pores nice and clean so the pimples won't be there! So when you see those bad Larry zits, it's a good sign it's doing its job! (I just wouldn't use this the night before a big event or presentation or something unless you have used it a few times!)"

The bubbles tingle so much so if you don't like that I don't recommend this. It starts bubbling really fast, almost seconds after I put it on the my face. And it takes FOREVER to take off.

Goes on smooth then u can hear and feel the bubbles form. After 5 mins, rub it in, and then rise. While rubbing in it starts to form more bubbles. I think I applied too much because u only need a thin layer. I love the way my skin feels. Super smooth especially on my nose but it doesn't take out any dry acne scaring the way exfoliating scrubs do. Will definitely use this once a week if my skin needs some baby softness."

Once washing it I use cold water instead and rub off the puffy parts with water. Leave the layer of the mask on me and gently rub it around my face. Do not leave the jar open because it reacts with O2 and will release the energy needed to do the carbonation on your face. Open it, grab what you need and close shut.

It does when the mask is bubbling up tickle, so doing this with friends is fun because you can laugh with each other. Do not put the mask too close to the mouth, nose, eyes or when the mask expands it will enter the areas and make it hard to see\\breath. Once the mask has bubbled for 6 minutes just massage your face and it goes back to its original texture; after that remove the mask. (I recommend using the mask directly before taking a bath\\shower) that way you feel cleaner after taking the mask off. I wouldn't say it's extremely difficult, just can get a little tedious. Someone mentioned that this brand is also cruelty free; I couldn't find any more information about it but that is something to also be happy about while using it.

If you don't put it on thin the bubbles will eventually grow out so large that it will close around your nostrils and then your lips and eyes. So be careful! 2.

The scent is light, and I didn't have any \"instant\" bubbling once applied to the skin, it took a while (which was nice, made application less messy). Overall I really like this product!

I I do not have sensitive skin at all, so I was surprised when the sensation went from the typical tingling/tickle of the bubbles to full on 'OMG I have to take this off immediately!'.

After about 5-10 min when you finally go to wash it off, you will notice your face looks like a cloud. It will amuse you. But then when you wash it off, your face is going to feel like silk. Especially if you moisturize afterwards, your skin feels great. It is incredibly messy to wash off, but if you are careful then it won't be an issue. Also, most clay masks smell horrific, but this one has the most pleasant herbal flowery type scent. I only use this mask once a week, but each time it is great. One thing to take into consideration, don't use it when you have a cold like I did. When it gets itchy, and your nose is running... it is absolute hell and you will wash it off within two min. (trust me, I learned from experience. You just don't know if it is the mask itching or your nose is running and it is dripping down your face. It is unpleasant but I blame the cold not the product.lol)"

A few notes on when using this product: - A little goes a long way, so don't use too much. It will get thicker once it bubbles (and it bubbles quickly). - Only put a small amount around your nostril areas. I made the mistake of putting a lot on my first use and it bubbled into my nose a bit! It tickled and I was able to clean it right away. - Store in a dry, cool place.

The mask even takes off makeup! Try not to laugh. The bubble will go up your nose and burn. Keep a tool near by to help prevent the bubbles from going into unwanted areas. You could also use this as a spot treatment to help unclog those trouble areas like your t-zone. This mask will leave your face feeling tight, but not necessarily dry like other clay masks.

Just use your head, keep it open only when you're using it, and close it so it's not exposed to the elements after that. I do recommend for first time users to keep it away from the underside of your nose because of the ticklish carbonation. Getting it close to your nostrils when it's clay and then it blowing up to a cloud, it tends to go a little inside your nose and tickles like mad! Love the product, just wish it ships faster (it literally took 3 weeks for me). Going to order 3 at a time next go round!"

I washed it off with COLD water because my face felt like it had been sun burned. It took a while to get off because the clay pack is legit. Certain parts of my face did feel smooth, but overall, I can't use this for my whole face.

However, the smell of it was overwhelming to me (like a fake perfume ingredient, not a natural ingredient). As it sat on my skin, my skin started to burn. I tried to wait the five minutes, but couldn't. The coating it leaves after you rub the bubbles down (as recommended) was difficult to wash off. Since my face was burning so much, washing it off felt like it was taking forever. After getting it off, my skin did feel soft, but I had a neon red flush across my skin like it had given me a chemical burn, and the areas where the rosacea is worse on my face were deep red. I immediately put my soothing toner and hydrating lotion on, but it has been over 30 minutes and my face is still hot to the touch and looks scalded. I have very sensitive and fair skin, and this is a definite no-go for me. The reason I did not give one star is because it did make my skin feel softer, so it may be more beneficial to people without such sensitive skin."

It was a little difficult for me to apply the product with the spatula, so in the future I will probably use a mask brush when applying. I made the mistake of putting on a thick layer, which I believe you only need a thin layer for this product to work or the removal will be a little time consuming. When it is first applied it appears to look like a clay mask. As you let it sit, it begins to foam and bubble up, which is super fun to watch. It does tickle a little bit while it is foaming, but nothing that would make me want to wash it off. I believe I left mine on for about five minutes. The directions say 3-5 but you could leave it on longer and it would be okay. This part threw me off a bit, but it wasn't a bad thing: I figured since it bubbled up and turned into foam, that it would remove like a foaming cleanser. I was wrong! You are supposed to manipulate the mask a bit after you let it foam up, and to my surprise it was still clay like under all of the bubbles. Once you manipulate and massage the mask the foam dissolves and you are back to your clay mask. This is where it gets to be a little annoying if you gobbed the mask on like I did. If you accidentally put on too much, I would suggest removing with a damp, hot towel. If you put on a thinner amount, you should be okay removing it with either a cotton pad or just water and your hands. My skin felt soooooo soft and looked brighter after using this mask. The next morning I noticed that a spot I have healing had decreased in redness by 50% - I'm not sure if it was this mask, or a combination of my skincare routine, but I am so satisfied. I would recommend this product to literally everyone!"

It smells great, the only thing is it is a bit hard to clean off but its not the end of the world. I've used it on a clean face and an oily face and my face always feels cleaner after using it and I haven't seen any adverse effects like breakouts or irritation."

I also found that the mass is drying which is fine if you have oily skin, and since I have a combination it works fine. JUST REMEMBER TO MOISTURIZE.

I notice once you start to massage your face after it had bubbles for 5 minutes, it seem like there were a lot of products on my face for such a little amount that I put on. They should redirect to once you massage the face for two minutes, wash it off with a warm cloth instead of hand. It took me 5 plus min to wash the clay off. After I wash my face I notice it was soft but my pores look the same. Overall, it was a fun experience. I'll will definitely give it another try next week."

It was definitely worth the buy because my skin feels super clean and soft afterward. It removed a lot of the excess sebum and impurities without stripping all the skin's natural oils. Pros: -Fun mask due to the bubbles -Leaves skin clean and soft, good for oily/combo skin -Short time compared to other masks (minimum is 5, but you can go up to 10 if you want) Cons: -Tingling or burning may occur depending on your skin sensitivity -Bubbles might be a bit uncomfortable for some people -Might be difficult to remove, see tip below Helpful tip: Put this mask on before you go take a shower. Once you go take a shower, you can wash it off in there with less hassle than struggling to take it off at the bathroom sink. I haven't seen any major differences in skin such as blackheads going bye bye yet, but like any mask that'll take time to see. Would definitely update, but I still would just recommend for how fun and effective it has been for my oily skin in terms of softness and oil removal at the moment. Also, if you're worried about getting a fake (since a lot of foreign products can be.counterfeit), you can check by first looking if the box has a Elizavecca Original sticker, scratch the foil for the QR #, and verifying on the Elizavecca website through the QR code link. And if ingredients is a concern, Memebox is the best source since it lists the ingredients in English. Update: After using this mask consistently and now on my second tub, I can say that it definitely helped in clearing my oily/now a bit more combo skin. My skin is still soft and clean after each use, and in fact my pores reduced in size! Slowly but surely. My blackheads are mostly gone too (90% with just a little on my nose). I still recommend this product after almost a year of use. Finally to note, it seems that Elizavecca updated their box packaging a bit as my second tub now has instructions and ingredients in English."

I found opening your pores with warm water works most effectively for the end result.

Leaving the product on for 10-15 minutes once a week leaves my skin feeling fresh and smooth. It's also hilarious to see and feel the mask fizz before your eyes!"

It's subtle, goes away and kind of just smells earthy to me. I love how little of this product I need to use to cover my whole face. Just the amount that was on the cover I lifted off of the jar was more than enough, meaning this will last me a while. It bubbles pretty quickly, and continues to bubble and expand throughout the 5 minutes and kind of tickles! After the 5 minutes I wet my hands and massaged it into my face again for a couple minutes and left it on for another 2 minutes before washing it off. It was a bit hard to wash it off, however, and took a bit of time to get it all off my face. Afterwards, my skin feels really soft and nice. Second day update: This morning when I woke up before work, my face was more moisturized and plump feeling, and this was the only thing I did differently. Recently, I've been breaking out a bit, and I never usually suffer from pimples or acne. Today the new pimples I've recently been struggling to get rid of are significantly smaller in size and look like they're on their way off my face. I don't know if the mask is what helped with this, but it did happen the day after using the mask. Also just from how soft and nice my skin feels after this mask, I'm really happy with this product."

I'm super-duper oily in my T-zone and dry on my cheeks with a ton of blackheads on my nose. This mask caused me no irritation or discomfort, it does tickle and feel like there's bugs running around on your face. I did not see significant improvement in my skin after the first use but my skin was definitely much softer and clean. For the price it is a great buy and I would say this is definitely my 2nd favorite mask. (My first favorite costs $60 though...) This comes with the product in a plastic jar with a little putty spoon in the lid. I first used my sensitive skin formula face wash and patted my face dry. I then used the putty-spoon to apply this to my face focusing first on my T zone. It began bubbling and fizzing up immediately as it touched my skin, but not while on the spoon or in the jar which was really cool. I let it sit for like 5-6 minutes and it literally bubbled up from probably a centimeter off my skin to about an inch! Be careful putting this around your nose and eyes because it gets big. I rubbed it back in and let it sit for another minute before rinsing it off. I was surprised at how easily it rinsed off the skin. Overall I loved this product and it definitely makes your skin softer and cleanses. I used a biore strip after using this mask and pulled nothing off my face. It's definitely worth the buy, if not for the cleansing power than for the experience of using a carbonated face mask."

I've heard a lot about this bubble clay mask from other people and on-line and I saw it at local Korean cosmetic shops. The cost to buy from local shops is way more expansive than buying it on Amazon. I decided to give it a try since it is relatively cheap on Amazon and it has prime shipping. I had no idea what to expect the first time I used it. I used the plastic spatula included to scoop out a quarter size amount. Then I used my fingers to spread it across my face. As soon as the mask touch my face it started to bubble and foam very quickly. Before I could finish covering my entire face, the part of my face that was covered earlier has already completely foamed up. So, you have to work very quickly. The second time I used it, I worked much faster and it was okay. I noticed my skin appears smoother after use. Some reviewer said their pores seems to shrink but I have to say I haven't noticed significant change in pore size. Maybe I haven't use it enough to notice a difference yet. I do feel like the mask pulls out the dirt in my poles and my face feels fresh and clean after using it. Overall, I would recommend this bubble clay mask."

While it was foaming on my face it was a very itchy feeling but once you wash it off my skin felt amazing and I couldn't wait to put the mask on again. Highly recommend this product!!!"

I gave this 4 stars because I used this for a while now and it doesn't get rid of pores as it says. Well, I guess it takes some dirt away but not a lot.

I'm not sure if it's because I applied too much product on my face- but when it started to tingle and tickle my face, it was soo annoying. I couldn't stand the feeling. My entire face felt itchy. I normally wouldn't classify my skin as sensitive, but I couldn't handle the tingling sensation on my face. It felt like I had spiders crawling all over.

My sister put on a much thicker layer and when the mask bubbled, it looked so horrifying! When it came time to washing the mask off, that was a bit difficult. I had to wash a few times to really get everything off. My sister had a much harder time because she had more on. After washing it off, my face felt nice and soft. However, my sister says the mask is too dehydrating for her. She says her face felt too dry after using the mask. Not sure if it's because she used more of the it than I did. My skin type is normal and my sister's is combination with oily T zone and normal elsewhere. *** Update 2/5/2017 *** One tip to easily get the mask off the face is to wash it off with a face towel. I find this works much better than trying to wash it off with just water."

I will say that it is itchy while its bubbling and its kind of hard to rinse off. Other than that, it works great, especially for the price."

The instructions aren't in English, but I saw this in a video on Facebook and it looked easy enough. It comes with a little spoon/ladle that you use to apply the clay. The consistency of the clay is very smooth. It kind of reminded me of cake frosting. Almost immediately after applying it to my face it started to foam up. And it continued to foam up the longer I kept it on my face, which was very amusing. After a few minutes, I rubbed the foamy clay all over until it resembled a normal clay mask and then waited another few minutes. I could still feel it fizzing on my skin which felt tingly. After I finally washed it off, my skin felt firmer and very refreshed. I just started using this so I'm not sure of the long-term results, but I'll be sure to update my review if anything changes. So far I definitely recommend. This would be a lot of fun at sleepovers."

It is a mild mask even though it has a menthol-like sensation. The product is a grey clay mask that bubbles up once it is applied on the skin. It feels fresh and tingly on the skin... the clay should draw out impurities from the skin. But I have found that it does not really dry up on the skin. The instructions are in another language, so my different occasions of using this mask I have tried different things such as leaving it on for different amounts of time. It just does not dry hard. I have also tried smoothing the mask back into my face after it had bubbled up- that does not seem to make a difference in performance. Removal of the Elizavecca Piggy Carbonated Bubble Clay mask takes some work. I find it easiest to remove it while showering- lots of water and rubbing. Conclusion: I have used it a few times and shared the product with friends... along with taking photos to share the puffy face. After using the product my skin is left feeling velvety soft, it is nice, but I do not think there is any other benefit... no pore tightening, no deep cleansing of pores or drawing out impurities, no reducing the size of my pimples, no exfoliation, no hydration."

Note that this mask suds up like soap. - Lastly pat dry That's it! I do this mask about 1 - 2x a week (: Love it!"

I've used so many things that claim to get rid of blackheads -- but aside from using gelatin (and using the pinterest trick where this forms sort of like a pore strip), *nothing* would work. Then...I found this stuff. It's a dream come true. My nose is blackhead free and feels as smooth as a baby's bottom. You use a scoop to apply this stuff to your face. It goes on like a normal clay mask. After about five minutes, this stuff starts to foam up. It's super tingly and really feels like it is penetrating my skin. After a little while, massage this stuff into your skin. Then wash it off. I swear by this stuff now. Thanks to this, my nose no longer looks like a polka dot of blackheads!"

It was a little hard to rinse off because it was so thick. But afterwards my face felt a little tight and even though I apply lotion it felt dry but I think that's a good thing especially if you have oily skin. 5/5"

Anyway, it's a hassle doing it. The powder gets everywhere, it only keeps for so long, getting all that caked on clay off your face feels like it's doing more damage than good. To me, this mask is the next generation of clay masks. It not only cleans deeper, but it's also easier to get off than the standard clay packs and it has a nice warming feel on the face. Caolin also makes a nice one, but this review isn't about that. Don't be thrown off by the packaging, if you aren't feeling it - I'm normally a more elegant packaging girl myself - but because this stuff really does work, I'm keeping it. Great for a deep clean after a summer day, fishing on the lake or anytime you know you're going to be a greaseball. It lifts it all off and leaves you feeling real fresh!"

My fifteen year-old daughter heard about it (we're both recent converts to the wonders of Korean skin routines) and we decided to try it, if only to be able to say we owned a facial product called \"Milky Piggy\". We usually use clay masks to purify and de-oil our skin. This works better and you get a good laugh to boot. It comes with a little spatula. Use it. If you stick your fingers in this stuff, it starts the foaming process in the jar, which is not what you want. Scoop some out, spread it all over your face and feel the sparkly party begin. Wait for 8 minutes and try not to scratch or sneeze (it tickles!). Your face will feel like it has ginger ale bubbles all over it. Pretty soon you will have a smooth, thick layer of foam on your face that makes your features look lumpy and misshapen. While you're waiting for the 8 minutes to end, go leap out at someone and scare the pants off them. I recommend washing this off in the shower. Especially if you're fifteen and splashy at the sink. It's gray and foamy and it doesn't just wipe off. You put a little water on your face and massage the mask into a creamy consistency and then gently wipe with fingers and more water until it's gone. It may take a bit, so be patient. Your face will be soft and clean and all the crud in your pores will be under siege. Plus you just had the most fun at-home facial ever!"

I'm almost out and will be buying some more soon! I use it about once a month, and it's just now getting low.

Once your whole face is fluffy (it does not run) you pat the bubbles down and let it sit a little longer before washing off. Thankfully it does not leave your skin feeling weird or stripped. Pros: -There is a LOT in this little tub. -It comes with a spatula that fits inside the cap. Super sanitary! -It's fun. Honestly. Bubbles on your face? Yes. -Leaves skin clear and feeling lovely Cons: -Long shipping time. :( I wish it was exfoliating as well, but that's personal preference. Overall, it was a great buy and I would buy again."

It's recommended to leave it on for 5 minutes which is kind of difficult since you want to scratch so badly the entire time. However, even with the itchiness I would still give this a solid 5 stars.

This stuff is fairly inexpensive, comes in a large container so you can do multiple applications, and goes to work in seconds. Plus the whole mask only takes about 5 minutes so it is perfect for someone who wants a little pampering but doesn't have a ton of time to waste. I love it! I love the foaming action it gives and it left my skin feeling super soft and incredibly clean. I even went the next day without makeup and had three different people (which is a lot for me seeing as I work in a small office) comment on how great my skin looked! Buy this stuff, use it, love it, throw all your other masks away. Pro tip: at the end of the 5 minute bubbling time, rub the mask in with your fingers, kinda like you would normally wash your face. This helps it become a little more effective and really delivers a final \"push\" to get all the dirt and grime off your face. Hope y'all enjoy!"

Way more than I get from the standard mask. It is a struggle to wash this off in the sink (bubbles everywhere!), but fun to wear in the meantime. I ended up buying another jar immediately. Learn from my mistake: WATCH THE SELLER.I didn't notice I wasn't buying from Elizavecca the second time around (until it was too late). The jar that arrived was green-hued. The product inside was sort of green-hued (not the blue/grey I originally had). It took a half hour to \"kind of\" bubble up when I finally got up the nerve to test it. My skin hadn't changed. This was a far cry from the actual product I originally received. The second jar was such a disappointment that I am hesitant to buy another."

I used the spatula to quickly applythe clay on my face and then massaged a little on face with fingers in circular motion. Kept it for about 20-25 minutes and washed it off with warm water and cold water after. I saw many comments saying it was a hassle to take it out but I didnt have any problem. I figured that was may be cause I didn't use a lot of clay and I also massaged it making it a thinner layer. Anyways, my face felt softer and pored did appear a little smaller. Having super oily skin, I was afraid that in the morning I would have oilyness back again, but suprsingly it was way less oily than it usually is. So, after it really worked. I can't wait to use it every two days at night now."

Only downside is that it doesn't wash off very easily so if you are washing your face over a sink, it may get messy. Otherwise I use it before I take a shower and then just wash it off in there. :) Skin is left feeling fresh and clean and looking renewed!"

I've been looking for a replacement for my favorite mask, Nu Skin's Epoch mask. I always loved it, it's scent free, but it's kinda spendy and it did dry my skin a little. For about the past month I've gone off all migraine prescription meds and have been trying cannabis for my migraines. I have a few methods, but one is a cannabis balm/salve that I can put on my forehead and temples. It does help. But it's \"fat based\", because that's how your body absorbs cannabinoids, though fat cells. So even though it works, when I have a bad migraine and use it multiple times. It is oily. This made my need to find a new mask product greater! (In unrelated advice, if you're stuck on topamax and imitrex or zomig for migraines, I suggest getting off of it. They cause so many rebound headaches, and those medications aren't good for you. I've noticed so many small changes in my body, skin, hair, and teeth since I got off those meds. Not to mention LESS headaches, I do get migraines but all those medications CAUSE more rebound headaches.) So back to this amazing mask! I am on the other side of a severe 2 day migraine. I got up this morning, feeling better, also looking like I've been to hell and back. I ate breakfast, had some coffee. I used this mask, because like I said my forehead was greasy. I don't want to get clogged pores! My skin looks amazing! It's my second time using this product. My skin is so soft and smooth. Pores teeny. I LOVE that there is a light scent, but it's hardly noticeable. Another brand i tried from amazon \"Deep Sea Mud Mask\" was so scented I couldn't stand it. This happy pig mask doesn't dry my skin out AT ALL. The first time I waited a while to moisturize, because I wanted to see if my skin was dried out. NOPE. No dry flaky looking skin. My only complaint is the directions are in Korean (maybe?!) so I did watch a youtube video to make sure I used it right."

I originally heard about this product through a Facebook video ad - looked it up on Amazon and with all the amazing reviews and price, what did I have to lose? The container itself is really small - a bit disappointing in size but when applying the clay to my face, I hardly used very much. Probably used a portion size similar to a grape. I think the container could provide around 20-30 uses. As far as the product itself - it starts to bubble pretty quickly after applying so you need to be quick. Once it was applied, I left it on for nearly five minutes as it began to bubble over. One thing I wasn't prepared for was the bubbles slightly tickling the face; kind of makes you want to itch but it's really no big deal. The Facebook video ad I watched, the girl popped all the bubbles by lightly pressing on the them and then massaged the clay on her face to look like a real clay mask (I of coarse did this - also side note, the container and packaging have no english instructions what so ever so the Facebook ad served as great instructions). Massaging the left over clay on my face felt great! Velvety. I left it on for another 3 minutes and then finally washed it off. The clay definitely left my face feeling squeaky clean. All my pores looked clean and most importantly minimized. I tend to be on the slightly oily side in skin (no acne issues - an occasional zit or pimple and a few black heads but that's really just occasional) - after my skin started to dry, it started to feel pretty tight (so slightly drying). I used a thick moisturizer and left my skin alone all day. On my way to bed, I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth and literally took a double take in the mirror wondering if I had applied foundation earlier that day - my skin looked flawless! I occasionally have blemishes under my eyes/cheeks but my skin was completely even! I don't think I have ever used a product that has brought instant and amazing results like this - totally recommend it!!!"

I did this incorrectly the first time and saw very little change. A few days later I followed the right instructions and saw a dramatic difference. My large pores appeared clean and smaller. My oily skin was refreshed and not dried out. It does tingle but the instructions say to test before use to test for any allergic reactions.

You have this spatula and you're using it to smear the mask on your face, which has the consistency of pudding. I did my nose first because I knew that was the trouble spot, but it was like instant when it started foaming. Then again, it was pretty warm because of the sun when I was walking home with it, so I'll give that the benefit of the doubt. My face feels softer, especially my nose. The sides of my nose aren't as clear as when I use the Bior\u00e9 charcoal face scrub in the shower, though. However, this mask did dry up the acne I did have, so now they're not much trouble :) I used a little too much on my top lip because when it foamed to max capacity it was going in my nose. Don't use too little because it'll just dry and not do anything; use too much and you're a foam monster LOL But like the other scrub, when I took it off (with multiple paper towels), my face was red. Once it was off for a few minutes it was back to normal so nothing to be worried about. Though I was surprised that I felt no burning sensation like I usually do with the other. You may have to wash off your face multiple times to make sure you got it all off; appearances are deceiving and when a part of your face is still sticky you'll know. Overall, I am very pleased with it. It's a fun way to pamper yourself when you're having a bad day and the results make you feel (and look) good :)"

I personally wouldn't use it while you've still got heavy makeup on, but a light cleansing beforehand would be enough; this product will get the rest of the stuff off. Once you apply it, you spread the product over your face, avoiding your eyes, mouth, and I like to avoid my nostrils. The product will begin bubbling almost immediately, but reaches peak bubbling after about 5-10 minutes. Because this product bubbles, it expands past where you initially placed it on your face. For this reason, keep the product further from your eyes/eyelashes than you would with other masks. It's fairly easy to wash off with cool water, but it does take a few minutes since the product doesn't dry completely like other cream masks might. I just stand over the sink or get in the shower afterwards to wash it all off. Makes your skin feel VERY clean and helps tremendously with blackheads and helps my pores a little. Doesn't do anything for deep zits, whiteheads, scarring, etc...So if your problem is big pores and blackheads, this product will be great. It's not harsh, and doesn't leave my face feeling extremely tight like other clay masks. The bubbles DO get a little ticklish/itchy while they're forming. The smell is light and pleasant. It's got a goopy, thick consistency...almost like pudding. A small spatula is included to scoop the product, which is super nice! A topper underneath the lid holds the spatula in place. The packaging is NOT strong - don't drop this container or you might have little grey, bubbly goop everywhere. Store this in a cool place and make sure the lid is securely on after every use - if it's loose or the topper isn't on, it will begin to bubble in the package excessively and you will lose product. Overall, a very fun and quality product for those with pore or blackhead issues."

Once the wait time is over I.e.- we keep it on for about a half hour to fourty five minutes. If you can get past that, the results are so worth it. It is quite difficult to rinse off, that's why we're only rating it a 4 out of 5. However, it's moveable, breathe able, and your skin literally has no pores in result. Your skin will look and feel amazing, love it just as much as I love my glamglow."

I literally look like a grey cloud with this on my face, or that iPhone grey moon emoji in cloud form. Picture worthiness aside, it's a product that works! My skin feels very soft and clean after I wash it off, and I recommend that this product be used before showering so that it's easier to wash off because attempting to wash it off in front of the sink took a while. I really like the spatula it comes with, it helps with applying the product evenly on the face but be sure to apply it a bit away from the nostrils and eyes because it foams up rather high; the first time I used it it blocked my nostrils with how high it foamed and got onto my lashes. Don't forget to massage the product before washing it off, it helps with removing dead skin cells and I've noticed that it re-foams afterwards which theoretically should help with lifting up and off any dead skin cells and other gunk. This product does have a scent but it's pleasant and light, I think it shouldn't be an issue for most people. I have fairly sensitive skin and I haven't experienced any skin issues with this product. Be sure to check on the Elizavecca website if the product you receive is a legit product or not, there's a sticker on the packaging with a scratch off bar that will reveal a code to type in. Their website is a little confusing to navigate and very cluttered, but even with zero knowledge of Korean I was able to find the verification page."

It neither tickled nor hurt. It felt like I was \"sweating a lot\". After 5 minutes, I looked like Papa Smurf. This is the most amusing skin care product I have every used. BUT, it took forever to wash it off my face. Almost like washing your hands with a super slimy soap that you can't get off. It's probably better if you use a face towel. After drying my face, I noticed that not was I left with dry skin, but it was accompanied by micro red bumps on my face. They weren't super red, but definitely noticeable. As fun as it is to use, this is not something that I would ever touch again. This is not to say that it wouldn't work for others. There are many good reviews so give it a try."

You don't need to cleanse beforehand, you just put this on with the spatula and spread it on your face. Remember that the more exposure to air the jar gets the more it will expire so be quick with that application! Do not get this anywhere below your nose or near your eyes because it foams up and gets huge. You look like an angry grey cloud and you'll be even more angry if this gets up your nose or in your eyes. It does itch on occasion and that can be super weird to deal with just persevere! Once the mask is done bubbling and looks deflated then you rub it all over your face until it isn't that spreadable. Now here comes the most irritating part: washing it off. Washing this puppy off takes time and work because the second you add water and the whole thing becomes a sticky foaming cleanser. You have to constantly do multiple rounds of rinsing to get this fully off your face but it is so worth it. My skin feels and looks fantastic after using this and the blackheads seem to be completely gone or missing which is great! It's super fun to do with your friends and it works very well!

After putting it on my face right away it starts working so I have to be quick to smooth it on all around my face. The only TIP I have, and again this could just be me because it was my first time, do not put it so close to your eyes. My eyes were kind of burning although nothing got in them. I put the mask too close to my eyes. I could feel it working, my face felt like it was not burning but something was going on. It didn't hurt but it was different.

His skin is not sensitive, my skin is and easily gets irritated. I've used this product multiple times and am happy to report, no skin irritation! I do find the smell something I need to get used to. The first time, the smell was overpowering. I tend to use it once every few weeks (mostly because I'm lazy and have other products I love) and I've grown to mostly enjoy the smell. My partner liked the scent right away. After this is a carbonated mask, it does BUBBLE UP. It goes on kind of goopy and then foams up quite fast, in my opinion. BE CAREFUL of your eyes and nose. Foams up enough to intrude those areas if you put it close by. The feeling of it actually bubbling up is ticklish. My partner barely lasted five minutes before he had to wash it off. I lasted to about ten minutes. FUN THING. You can actually rub it back to a smooth consistency AFTER it foams up... and then it will foam back up. After washing off the mask (which can take a minute or two), my skin felt awesome. It had a nice glow to it and felt so smooth and nice. All in all, fun and awesome product. I even purchased one for a gift for my sister. SHE LOVES IT."

The mask bubbles on your face, but if you have ever used a bubble/carbonated mask before, this one is underwhelming. The best part about carbonated masks is feeling tons of bubbles \"pop\" on your skin, but with this mask you do not feel them. This is a clay mask, so it just feels like the mask is too heavy for you to feel any bubble action. I will say that my skin felt ok after using this product. My pores shrunk a bit and my skin felt tighter, though very dry. It feels like there is a lot of soap/detergent in it. It does a good job at cleansing your face. This is one of those masks that takes forever to wash off (most clay masks do). It gets everywhere and makes a mess. The results are definitely not worth the cleanup.I only gave it three stars because you can't feel the bubbles popping on your skin, and because it was very drying. I just think there are so many better masks out there."

It doesn't do much else, though. I have very oily skin with large pores and frequent acne, and I didn't find that it made my skin super smooth or anything. It's a pain to put on because it starts bubbling seconds after you start spreading it on your face, it tickles like mad, and it's hard to clean off. If you're someone with bad skin looking for a mask to help, you should look elsewhere. If your skin is nice and you want a fun, different mask once in awhile, then this one is kinda fun."

Yes it does bubble up faster depending on how oily your face it when applying it. And Yes it does itch alot when it bubbles but after that your face feels so refreshed and clean. I would recommend a face moisturizer if your skin gets to dry because it literally gets rid of all your oils. I work part time at a pizza shop and my face is naturally oily already but with the grease an oils there it makes my face super oily and when I applied it I didnt wash my face so it started working immediately. Its a fast acting mask so when you apply it id say to work slightly faster then with other masks. Also. When you wash it off it is EXTREMELY soapy and you dont wanna get it in your mouth lol it tastes bad. But it does have a nice scent and yes after applying the product some of the product will bibble up in the container but its okay cause its just reacting from the oils on the applicator that you used while dipping it back into the container. Other than that its a great product and I wish I could rate it more than five stars. So I highly recommend it to other people who have oily skin and like a refrest feeling after a face mask. No pain all gain!"

For starters, this mask is REALLY fun to apply. It comes out like a think clay (as the label states) and once exposed to oxygen in the air it starts bubbling up so you do have to apply it really fast before it starts bubbling. Once the mask has completely bubbled you massage it a bit more in the skin and then wash it off. Playing with the bubbles was fun cause I'm a dork haha. This product smells really good too so thats another pro. The only reason why I rated it 4 out of 5 starts is because this mask is supposed to do many things but a few are lightening up dark circles and attacking white/black heads. Its supposed to deep clean and get rid of problem areas on the skin. I felt as if my face was super duper clean after I used it but my black heads/ white heads remained the same and ive used this product many times now and still the same result. So it didn't feel that it did did cleaning but did make my face feel soft like a babies bum and clean at the surface. Overall, this product is so unique and cool and I would buy it again."

If you look it up on youtube you'll get a general idea of what it looks like and what it will do. I don't have sensitive skin, so I didn't feel any burns or anything. You do get a tingling sensation from the bubbles popping on your skin, but it's nothing bad. It's a little hard to rinse off, and would do so with an exfoliator and warm water for a faster process. My skin felt really hydrated, refreshed and soft afterwards! It's a pretty good size, I use it once a week and I still have plenty left. I use a small amount to create a very thin layer to cover my face, because as it bubbles up it sort of thickens. It's pretty fun to use with friends!"

This way works best for me and my stubborn blackheads because the steam in my shower opens up all the pores and it continues to clean my pores throughout my whole shower.

But it's a very minor inconvenience. However, the performance of this mask has done wonders for me. For about two years, my left cheek suddenly broke out really badly and left me with constant new blemishes and scars (and a terrible lack of confidence), but after using this maybe 3 times a week for about a month, I've noticed and felt such a difference. My pimples and zits have died down, only reappearing after a lazy night every now and then like how it used to be. My cheek is flatter, no more raised bumps and uncomfortable textured makeup. My foundation sits smooth on my improved skin and I'm in love with this mask. If they had this mask in a noncarbonated form, I'd throw all my money at it. I'll definitely be repurchasing regardless, though."

I used it already and have seen a difference in my skin. No, my acne did not disappear, but much of my redness and some cystic acne did go away! Also, my nose is literally so nice and clean now. Wow. My best friend commented on my skin saying that it looked \"clean\", so I'm pretty sure this mask has done something! Now, please use this mask for no more than 5 minutes and massage it in for 2 minutes, then remove by washing your face. Don't remove it immediately after it bubbles up, that's not how it works. Believe me, if you've read reviews by Korean users, that's exactly how they recommend using it for the product's effectiveness. Individuals who remove it with a washcloth, I mean go ahead, but it's better to remove it by washing it off to prevent further micro exfoliation that causes redness and irritation. It's a great mask overall if you don't mind the feeling of your face being tickled and you wanting to scratch your face. It's worth it and I recommend it! :)"

It is a so-so mask, fun to take pictures of, but not anything I would buy again. I feel like this is good for people under 25 that already have decent-good skin (skin that is smoother, no wrinkles or fine lines, no to minimal enlarged pores, etc).

The only reason for 4 stars is because I felt like it didn't do much for my face in the way of hydration. It didn't dry my face out at all it just didn't add anything extra either. I will order this again once I am out because I do like the deep clean it provides. When applying the mask be mindful of your nostrils and your eyelashes because the foam grows quite a bit and when I blinked I got some on my eyelashes and it tickles the inside of your nose if you aren't careful."

It's a pain in the butt to wash off if you just go the water route...it makes it kind of slimy and just move all over the place, without really leaving your face. My face always feels super soft after using it.

My son (3) thinks it's fantastic. \"What's that on your face?\" he laughs. I laugh too, because it's goofy. In the jar, it's kind of like sticky Silly Putty - it's shiny and goopy. A little goes a long way, and it does come with an internal lid and plastic spatula for scooping some out. I really love that about Asian beauty products - no sticking your fingers right into the jar here, no indeed. It feels a bit sticky going on, and I actually find it a bit stubborn to remove. I prefer to rinse in the shower versus at the sink, because it just takes a little too much water and elbow grease. As part of a three-step pore cleanse, it's been pretty effective for me; no complaints here. The main reason I give four stars rather than five is how hard it is to rinse off. Kind of a downer at the end of a really fun experience."

And this product is what has convinced me to try even more korean skincare products. I think that it is all in moderation. Once the mask bubbles up, I wait for it to begin to tingle. I rub the bubbles out and then rinse off. It is a bit difficult to rise, like any other clay mask, but plain water works just fine.

I think a little goes a long way, it bubbles pretty thick and once it starts bubbling (which doesn't take very long) it definately expands out too not just up, so the container should last for many uses. Which also makes me love the price! You can buy masks at makeup stores for ten times the price that last for two uses and that's ridiculous.. Also note that when putting this on your face, once you have your scoop make sure to close the lid up again since being exposed to light and air is what makes it wanna start bubbling! And I've read that it will keep best stored in a darker cupboard/closet fyi"

The packaging it adorable as well the product. The cream itself it a thick, grey gel like paste. It comes with a little white spatula to apply the product to your face so it doesn't get all over your hands. It is really cold to apply but feels great. As soon as you start putting it on it starts foaming up on your face. You don't want to leave the lid off your product too long because it will start foaming up in the container. You leave the mask on for 5-10 minutes and let it do its thing. It starts to tickle after a few minutes. After its been on for 5 minutes or more you run it in and run the bubbles away. This turns it back into a clay mask. It will start foaming up again after that but not as much. Then wash the mask off with water. I found jumping in the shower is better because it soaps up while you're washing it off. Afterwards, my skin felt so nice and soft. I use it 2 to 3 times a week. I even got my boyfriend to try it."

I really love this mask, it is fun and fairly easy to use. I know some reviewers have said that it is a little difficult to rinse off. I usually put it on 5 minutes before I am going to hop in the shower. Once you pat the bubbles down, if you massage the....goop? into your face it will lather up and kind of working into the consistency of face wash, which I find a lot easier to remove. I defiantly find that my face is less oily for several days after using the mask, which I use once a week. I do not have sensitive skin, but I have accidently left this product on my face longer (15 minutes) then the recommended time frame of 5 minutes. (random phone calls with people who wont shut up) my face did start to burn and tingle more then usual, but once I rinsed it off there was no redness or irritation and I went on with me life. I would recommend to anyone with oil skin. and I would / will purchase again!"

Overall, i love how fun and effective this mask is. i recommend it to anyone looking to have fun and stay beautiful at the same time. its also really great to do with kids! i took it to a babysitting gig and they were entertained for most of the night"

First of all I'm a beauty product junkie with a capital \"J\" and I've tried almost every mask to drugstore to department store and this little gem is amaze-balls. The mask is from South Korea so there's no English on the packing, INSTRUCTIONS: So put the mask on a clean face, leave on for 15 mins and rinse off (as time passes the mask gets foamy), but it's difficult to rinse off. So I use a clean warm washcloth to soften the mask and then rinse with warm water. After using the mask for the first time last night, my husband actually commented on how he couldn't see my pores and that my face was super-duper soft. Tonight the mask is going on my husband, but he doesn't know it. shhhhhh....."

It bubbles a LOT, so avoid putting it under your nose, unless you want to snort bubbles. :) It tickles so much and you'll want to wash it off, but don't. This clay mask is very drying, so don't leave it on forever. Maybe wash it off before all the bubbles pop.vIt is somewhat difficult to wash off, so I would recommend doing it in the shower.
