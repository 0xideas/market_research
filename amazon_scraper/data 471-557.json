However, all you have to do is Google the product or check Pinterest for the How To. You apply it evenly to an unwashed, dry face. Let sit for 5 mins or until all over bubbles (you'll hear and feel them). Rub in for 1-2 mins, then wash off. Pat face dry. Apply toner/moisturizer or make up as normal, or go fresh faced! This product is seriously worth it. I have an oily T-zone, but otherwise clear skin and this is great for me."

One downfall is that I have very dry skin, so I did have to moisturize after using the mask. But other than that, it minimized my pores and left my skin feeling so clean. However, I did notice that after using it, I started breaking out more on my forehead. I'm not sure if that has anything to do with the product or just my skin. Overall, I recommend trying the mask.

It's so twisted that they have the marketing mascot as a pig...who is wearing the face mask...with dead pig ingredients in it. It's just gross. They don't animal test but using animal ingredients is just as bad and cruel. Do not recommend if you like your skincare cruelty free."

Searched for it online and finally found it for a reasonable price on Amazon, ordered it and waited. Wahh. The expected delivery date was 1 month away... no, no, no. To my surprise, it arrived on my doorstep sooner than I expected. I rushed home and couldn't wait to get it out of the box and onto my face. It has a unique smell to it. . Don't leave the cover off for too long or it will start to bubble itself. I tried to use the little spatula that it came with, but I'm a hands/fingers type of person. Needless to say, the spatula is still sitting on the cover and it hasn't come off since. You must be quick to apply it because it starts foaming immediately. Don't apply too much around your nose and eyes, it will foam up and you wont be able to breathe or see. LoL. Washed my face and O.M.G. My skin never looked so nice or felt so smooth. I couldn't wait to use it again. Totally recommend."

I was excited to try out my new clay mask and put it on as soon as it came. It bubbles VERY quickly so you have to work fast. It tickles a little, but it's fun! When you wash it off it really is a clay mask under all that fluff. So did it defeat my blackheads? Not exactly. I didn't seem to have the life changing experience with it that everyone else did. However I'm thinking I see a reduction in those blackheads around my nose, but I'm not sure if that's just me convincing myself the mask did something. It does leave your skin soft, but mine was also a little dry so you will want moisturizer afterwards. All in all, I don't know that it's necessarily a magic blackhead eraser, but it sure is fun! I would buy it again just for the bubbles!"

But i can feel the bubble popping at after a while i massages the bubble for 2 mins and rinse it off. I have oily/sensitive skin so after drying off my face i put some toner and my face feels warm, reddish and its still itchy. I guess I am that sensitive. I dont know how I should feel about this product, it seemed to be working but ghe itchness and redness is a no-no for me. I guess i can try it again and see what happens if my face will react the same way after second use. Question. How often can you use this product?"

I have struggled with horrible acne since I was 13 (I'm 20 now) and this mask was a dream come true. HOW I USE IT: I usually use the mask 2-3 times a week. I put it on before I take a shower. I get a small amount (a little goes a long way here) and rub it all over my face. WAIT 5 MINs! That ALL it takes AMAZING!! After five mins wet your fingers and gently rub your face till the mask feels creamy everywhere. Then get in the shower and wash it off first thing (it will bubble a whole lot so keep your eyes and mouth shut. It doesn't actually burn your eyes though just fyi). Personally I don't like to get this product on my lips (I have very sensitive lips) so use your own method for that. Overall this is THE BEST face mask I have ever used. I have been to many dermatologists for my acne and I have tried everything from pills to washes to help my skin and nothing but THIS AMAZING PRODUCT has helped. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU Elizavecca!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3 <3 <3"

I have heard nothing but amazing things about it. So I bought it of course. My best friend and I were going to try it together. We were both so excited. A day before I did the actual face mask, I tested it out on my hand to make sure it was ok. Everything was fine. The next night when we put the masks on our faces, it began to sting a little. I figured the mask was just doing its job. But then we started to feel more and more stinging. Which eventually turned into burning. We washed our faces off as soon as we could and it ended up CHEMICALLY BURNING OUR FACES. We both had extremely red, raw, and sore peeling skin for weeks. I wish I could give this product 5 stars because I really wanted to, but I can't because I almost had to go to the ER for how badly it burned me."

The bubbles are like torture. I just want to scratch them. 2. There are no directions in the packaging. Well not in English anyway. I uploaded photos so you can see what I mean. 3. It's slimy when you start to wash it off. It takes a lot of effort to get it all off. 4. I love how fast it is. My other fave masks take 10-20 minutes. It's awesome to have a quick one! 5. I don't have to wash my face before the mask? That's kind of nice. And faster."

For those thinking about buying, know that the instructions and info are in Korean. However, you can find this information online, so fear not. The consistency of the mask is very goopy and you have to work fast to get it distributed across your face, otherwise it starts bubbling up. The bubbling feels funny and can itch a bit. Also, be warned that it feels a bit warm. I initially thought it was burning my face, but it's just residual heat from where the oxygen is creating a chemical reaction- thus the bubbling. After rinsing it off my face was soooooo smooth! Just make sure to put on some moisturizer because your skin will be a bit dry. In all, if you are on the fence about buying this product, give it a try! It's fun and totally worth the results!"

I got bored and once it stopped fizzing I squished it down and left it like that for about five minutes. once I wiped and then washed it off, my skin felt kinda tight, which made me worried. but, I let my face air dry and 10 minutes later I touch my forehead and its bump free!!! and my nose is super smooth!!!! all I have are reddish blotchy spots, which are going away, but I've always had those on my face (usually in between my forehead). anyways, long story short, I LOVE THIS!!! I'm planning to use it about once a week or once every other week, so my skin doesn't get deprived of natural healthy oils. 10000000/10 would recommend!!!! (I included a during & after picture)"

I even made my mom use it and she absolutely love it. The only thing i didn't like is that there are no instructions in english so i had to read it from a website. So basically after leaving this baby on your face for about 5 minutes and it's already bubbled up like crazy just massage it to your face for a few seconds then i wash it off with warm water. Make sure to use warm water and not lukewarm or cold water since this mask is so hard to remove. If your face starts getting itchy while the mask is bubbling up, it's totally normal. And it'll only last for a few minutes anyways. I then apply my regular moisturizer and my face looked so good."

The mask was easy to remove. I used a wash cloth and warm water. My skin felt nice afterwards. It was soft, clean and felt refreshing. A few days later I started to notice changes in my skin. I began to break-out which is highly unusual for me. My cheeks became very red, raw and sensitive. The worst however was the dry flakey skin accompanied by what looked like hives on my chin and around my lower lip. They were very itchy and popped up below my lower lip in clusters. I was panicking because I have never gotten such a horrible reaction to any skin care product before. I wanted to make sure that it was indeed this product that caused the reaction on my face so I waited a week before trying it again. I reapplied this mask a week after and I received the exact same reaction as I did the first time. I will not be using this mask anymore and am very disappointed. I really wanted this mask to work well but it was not for me. If you have sensitive combination skin, please save yourself the time, money and embarrassment and DO NOT buy this product."

I want this to work. 3.13.18 While I wanted this to work, I was highly disappointed. I found it to have a choking perfume smell. It's sticky, which makes it more difficult to use than ordinary clay mixtures and works no better for me than a good clay. It was mildly irritating to my skin, more so than my first applications of clay. While it did not cause bad itching, that could be because of years of using clay, and it did not improve over time, so I have stopped using it."

Very upset. embarrassed to leave the house and my New Year is off to a really bad start! I will be staying home for at least another week. I may have to go to the Doctor if the swelling won't go down. I am taking benadryl and I may need some steroids. I wouldn't touch this product. I think it is more novelty and fun with foam. Let me tell you also that I have skin that is NOT sensitive. Still have blackheads and I look like someone punched me in the eyes and set my face on fire. Happy New Year!!! USE WITH CAUTION!!!!

This carbonated mask looked super fun to use so I ordered it on a whim to get me up to the one day shipping threshold. The mask comes with a small spatula under the lid and zero instructions in english, so I had to google to find out how to use it. You're supposed to apply a thick layer to unwashed skin and leave it to bubble completely, around 5 to 7 minutes. Then you can either rinse it off or rub it in, then rinse with lukewarm water. The mask is somewhat stretchier than a normal clay mask- almost like a starchy pudding. I used the spatula to apply it, and made sure that I didn't leave the container open too long. I'm not sure if it's the oils or the air that causes the reaction so I made sure to avoid contaminating the jar with either. I ended up leaving mine on for 8 minutes to get the full bubble effect, and then I tried to rinse. The bubbles came off easily but the underlying mask was harder to remove and kind of slimy. I ended up having to use a konjac sponge soaked in steaming water to get the mask off, but it came off easily with that combo. It took a LOT of rinsing to get the mask out of my sponge so make sure you use a backup one or a washcloth. My skin afterward looked super smooth and hydrated, so the work was worth it. I followed the rest of my routine and have had zero issues with this affecting my skin negatively. Overall, this is a fun mask that I would recommend to anyone looking for a twist on a clay mask. I think that it would be a good idea to use this in the shower when I try it again next week, just so it's less messy."

We all have different skin types: my baby sister is normal-dry, my oldest sister is oily, and my younger sister and I have combination-oily skin. It comes in a cute packaging with a plastic spoon to scoop the products out (so it's very handy for those who like it clean) but I personally prefer using my hands. You have to spread it on somewhat quick otherwise the product will sit on the face and start its process of carbonating. I followed the instructions and began to feel the carbonation working its magic perhaps 1-1/2 minutes in as it warmed up my face. Massaging it after 5 minutes and rinsing it off took longer than I expected--perhaps I put too much product on? But it was quite messy. Aside from that, I would say my skin felt very smooth and cleaned. I don't know if my face brightened at all but I plan to use this more to see the long-term effects. My sisters haven't used it yet but hopefully they like it just as much as I do."

Nothing I used seemed to improve my pores and it has always been a battle with the blemishes. I decided to give this mask a try and I couldn't be happier. It looks very similar to a normal clay mask and comes with a little spatula type tool to apply it. One thing I like is that you don't have to precleanse your face. Many masks have you wash your face, apply the mask, then wash it off. I feel like that is just too much for our sensitive facial skin. With this mask, you can just put it on (obviously don't do it on top of makeup or something). I love getting up and being able to brush my teeth, put on this mask, gather my clothes and such, and then hop into the shower to remove it. So simple! I wasn't sure what to expect, but the mask applies smoothly with the tool provided and then foams up as it is left on. Once it's all foamed up, the next step is to kind of smoosh the foam back down and massage onto your face as you would a soap. Lastly you rinse it off. When I use this mask, my face feels clean and refreshed but not dry, and I think it gives me a healthy glow. My skin also just feels lovely! When this product arrived, I had several breakouts and a particularly bad blemish in addition. After 2 uses of this mask, my skin has almost completely clear."

            "review_text": "I bought one for myself and one for my friend. She tells me she uses it all the time and it tingles when the bubbles start to foam. she loves using it. Her daughter even uses it. I have yet to use mine because I havn't found a tool to get it out of the container yet with out using my hand and ruining the whole jar. Once agian there are no instructions on the container so if your thinking of purchasing this product, here are the instructions. How to Apply Elizavecca Milky Piggy Carbonated Bubble Clay Mask It\u2019s simply to use a carbonated bubble clay mask. While it\u2019s not necessary to wash your face first, you should ensure that you do wash your hands. You can use the mask day or night, it doesn\u2019t matter. You don\u2019t have to wash your face in advance to use the mask, as you\u2019ll be rinsing your face off after you do use it. Many women choose to use the carbonated mask as a makeup remover. However, you can also use it in the last step of your skin cleansing program if you wish. If you wear long-lasting permanent makeup, you may wish to remove your makeup first, as the clay mask may not have enough cleansing power to remove it. The Milky Piggy comes with an included spatula. All you have to do is use the spatula to remove a small amount from the jar. You can use this to scoop out about a half a tablespoon of the clay product. This also keeps the quality pure. You can use the spatula to spread it over your face, or your fingertips. Gently tap it on the skin of your face, avoiding nostrils, eyes, lips, and hairline. You should be aware that the product does foam up so you may wish to place a smaller amount on your face than you would normally for a clay mask. You don\u2019t want to overdo it then have to worry that the clay may drip off. Ensure that it\u2019s evenly spread on your face. You don\u2019t want to leave any large blobs as these may fall off and leave you wasting product. Once the mask has been applied to your face, the carbonation inside the mask will cause it to froth up. It begins to froth up as it oxidizes with the air. This process will take about three to five minutes. You\u2019ll soon see how the gooey wet clay will start bubbling up, and become frothy, foamy bubbles. You\u2019ll notice how the foam has a lighter colour than the actual clay mask product. Many people like to watch this happen in a mirror. You will also experience a gentle tingling feeling on your skin. If you wish to provide additional benefits to your skin you can also use your fingertips to gently massage the clay around your face. You can do this for about one or two minutes. Next, apply some water to your face and continue to massage lightly. This will also help to remove the mask from your face once you\u2019re done. This type of clay mask differs from other types of clay masks in that it doesn\u2019t dry out. Don\u2019t bother waiting, or you\u2019ll be waiting for a long time. After the mask has stopped foaming, or about ten minutes, you\u2019ll now be ready to use a clean damp washcloth to wipe it off your face. Use only lukewarm water. Pat your face dry and you\u2019ll see for yourself how your face is so clean and refreshed! Ideally, you should leave your face free of cosmetics, but if you must apply, wait an hour or two to do so, perhaps in the washroom at work. You should use your clay mask only two or three times a week."

To preface, I have combo skin, with certain areas that are prone to becoming oily and irritated, while other areas can be dry. My skin is difficult to work with, and I often have a hard time finding products that will help with both oily and dry skin issues. When you use the mask, you MUST use the plastic spoon that came along with the package, as skin oil will activate the foaming ability. Once I applied it to my face, I let the mask foam up for about 10 minutes. The mask is going to foam *A LOT*, but it also provides a bit of a cooling sensation while its foaming. After 10 minutes on my skin, I went ahead and massaged the mask around my face using circular motions for 2-3 minutes, then rinsed the mask from my face. After using it, I definitely felt my skin being more well-balanced, toned, and that larger pores that I have (especially on my nose) are now visibly reduced. I'm going to give this a try on a weekly basis, and maybe increase to 2-3 times a week as my skin requires. For the price, I'm really impressed!"

Understandably, I am nervous to try new masks, as most all of them are too drying. Not the case with this mask! I exfoliated right before use, and patted my skin dry. Then, I used the spatula provided to swipe the mask over my skin. I wiped the spatula before sticking it back into the mask in order to keep the remaining mask in the jar from foaming. By the time I had finished applying the mask to my face, it had started foaming. The foaming action felt somewhere between a tingling and an itching, but not altogether unpleasant. After 5 minutes had passed, I gently wiped away the mask with a warm washcloth. My skin looked brighter, my pores were smaller (did not remove blackheads, though they were less noticeable), and my skin felt softer. I did start to feel some of the telltale \"tightening\" that us dry-skinned folks are well acquainted with, so I finished with some Jergens Ultra Healing lotion. My skin feels and looks much better, so I am working this into my skin care regimen from here on in!"

            "review_text": "I am always skeptical when it comes to the claims that skin care companies make about their various products, but I am quite pleased with the Milky Piggy Carbonated Bubble Clay Mask. To start, this mask contains the following ingredients: Water, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, White Clay, Acrylate Copolymer, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Methyl Perfluorobutyl Ether, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Lauramide DEA, TEA-Cocoyl Glutamate, Green Tea Extracts, Glycerine, Dipropylene Glycol, Bentonite, Collagen, Charcoal Powder, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Flavouring Agents, Carbonated Water, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Lavender Extracts, Monarda Didyma Leaf Extracts, Peppermint Leaf Extracts, Freesia Leaf Extracts, Chamomile Flower Extracts, Rosemary Leaf Extracts I am hesitant to use products that contain Butylene Glycol in them because it irritates my sensitive skin, but I had read so many great reviews of this mask, I thought I would give it a try. I did a small test swatch on my neck and after 24 hours, there was no reaction, so I moved on to putting it on my face. I did not develop the usual redness and itchiness that I experience with Butylene Glycol, but it does make my skin sting a bit, particularly if I am using it as one of the last steps in my cleansing process. To avoid this, on the days when I do use the mask, I use it as the first step when I wash my face. It effectively removes dirt and sebum from my pores and leaves my skin feeling quite clean, without feeling stripped and dry. You do have to apply the mask quickly as it bubbles up quickly. It takes about 10 minutes for it to reach peak bubbliness. I usually let the mask do its thing and rinse with lukewarm water after 15 minutes or so. For a deeper clean, you can massage the bubbling mask into your skin after a couple of minutes and then rinse after the usual amount of time. I have tried this and I prefer to just let it sit and do its thing. Overall, I am quite pleased with this bubbling face mask and have made it a regular part of my skincare regimen."

One is the white- creme colored one on the outside, then there is a clearish one separating the product from the air. on the Clear lid, there is a little paddle. The instructions are in another language, but here is how I use it. I scoop two little paddlefuls of the goop onto the inner whitish lid and then put the clear one back on the jar. 2 scoops is normally a generous amount. Then I talk my fingers and apply all over face. Avoid nose and mouth and eyes, this stuff puffs up nicely. I find something to do other than twitching from the tickles for about ten minutes or until it had puffed out and looks like a medium grey color ( it starts out as cloud grey). Then, since I hate having to clean this clay stuff off my sink ( the speckling globs are the worst), I use a paper towel to get the majority off my face. It sort of flattens like a souffle. I then wash the rest off with a washcloth or face scrubby. I read somewhere that it makes your face glow. I totally agree. It's fun, but the only downside I can see is waiting through tickle torture on your face for it to puff up. Other than that, I would recommend this product."

            "review_text": "This mask is AWESOME. I originally saw an ad with a reaction video for this product and just had to try it. It took really long for it to come but thats understandable since it did come from Korea. I've used this about 4 times since i've got it and each time it leaves my face super soft. It came with two trial sized creams that were also amazing: Tony Moly goat milk premium moisture cream and Tony Moly panda's dream white magic cream. I've only used the panda's dream once, it had kind of a weird glue sort of smell to it but the goat milk cream smells light and floral. The clay mask doesn't have a smell to it. There are no English instructions on the box or jar that it comes in so I had to look that up. You put about a chestnut worth of mask on your face (I applied it with the little applicator that they have in there, I'm not sure if that was the intended purpose but it works for me) and make sure you shut the container quickly since the product seems to react with the air. The consistency is kind of thick and goopy. Then you wait about 5 minutes and the product bubbles up like crazy. Be careful not to get it too close to your eyes or nostrils when you apply it because it can burn near the eyes and since it bubbles up you don't wanna breathe it in! After the 5 minutes is up I have been rubbing it in and then washing it off with a cloth and it really has been making my face crazy soft and I absolutely recommend it!"

I use it about 3 times/week (mature skin) and alternate it with a traditional clay mask that I customize with a few different essential oils and I also add a couple of other ingredients. This bubble mask seems to be quite refreshing for the skin, as well as clarifying. Once a apply, the foaming bubbles begin within 1 minute. After about 2 more minutes I use my cheap little hand face brush (the kind you can buy at Big Lots, etc., for about $3.00 - kind of like a large round bristled toothbrush). So I brush this in circular motion around my face and let it sit for another couple of minutes. VERY refreshing with all the excellent ingredients in this mask and I definitely recommend."

When I first opened it, the product looked like super wet hair gel or jelly. Putting it on was nearly impossible with the spatula so I used my fingers, but it was still hard to get on due to the jelly texture. I left it on for 10-15 min. At one point I did spread it around since I read that can increase the carbonation and it still didn't bubble up more. I don't know if it's just the one I got or if I did something wrong? My face was dry. I kept the container open only long enough to scoop some out and immediately sealed it up. On the plus size, I loved the tingling sensation and when I cleaned it off, my face feels super soft and tighter. So even if I didn't bubble up (which is why the three star review,) I did have a clean face that looked nice. I'm just really bummed I didn't get that fun experience everyone else seems to get with this product."

            "review_text": "My friend gave me this for my birthday since I've been into Asian Beauty products lately. Before I actually used this carbonated bubble clay mask, I looked at blog reviews and YouTube videos. There was a common theme and it was that this mask, as it bubbles, made their face itchy. So for a while I was hesitant to use it even when I received it as a present. However, I decided to try it out one day and you know what, it's pretty fun. You apply this to your dry face and within a minute (if not seconds) you can feel it bubble up. I assume this bubbling feel is what people meant as their face felt itchy, but I think they over exaggerated. After the mask has fully bubbled up, you massage it and let it sit for another 2 minutes before washing it off. I use this mask before I shower so I can wash it off as I'm showering. This means no more wet floors as you splash your face, trying to get that last bit of stubborn clay mask off. Do note that this mask is not like your typical clay mask in that it will dry up (or at least I've never gotten to that point). However, I do feel the result is similar to the typical clay mask that do dry up. Nothing special, it does what it states. But unlike other clay masks, this provides you with some entertainment (scary or not)."

It did make my skin feel really clean and smooth, but as someone who has combination skin that gets really dry in the winter and in certain areas in summer, this would not be my ideal mask. In addition I haven't noticed any changes or improvements to the size of my pores or blackheads from using this. However, this mask does retail for $19 and amazon sells it for much less so this would be a good deal if you or someone you know wants to try out this mask. It is definitely a fun mask to use! Heads up: it does get uncomfortable though when it foams up and makes you have a really strong urge to scratch your face, but I definitely think this mask is fun and good for sleepovers or to do with friends. The mask foams up SO much, its hilarious to see one do this mask."

I wash my face with my makeup removing wash prior to using the mask. Even though it says it can be used on dirty skin, I'm not willing to task that risk of having make up left on my face. I leave it on for 10 minutes, to really let it work its magic, and then I wet my fingers to smooth the bubbles down and turn it into a regular clay mask. I leave that on my face for about 3-5 minutes and then gently wash it off with a face loofa. I've been using it on a nightly basis for the past week, and every morning I wake up and my face is brighter, my pores are so much less visible, and my acne comes and goes away by the next day instead of hanging around. I have crazy sensitive skin too and it's not overs dying or making my skin feel raw after the fact. I'm pretty sure I'm stocking up on this stuff before I can't find it anymore!"

My skin did seem very clean after, but my unicorn mask does the same thing with no weird pain sensation."

Box it comes in has a scratch off foil to indicate authentication code as well. The product is kept fresh by a plastic seal once you unscrew the lid, and has a small spatula to scoup product out with that locks onto the lid when your done with it. I recommend taking enough out to cover your face at once as the product starts to foam/bubble immediately on contact when spread on the face. Use on totally dry skin, and let sit for 5 minutes (or more, if you really want to) then wet your hands and scrub the foam into your skin for around 2 minutes before washing off. I like to use it 2-3 times a week at night. If you have sensitive skin like I do I wouldn't recommend using it more than 3 times in one week tops. I would absolutely reorder this product when I run out."

The bubbling effect of this mask is definitely a lot of fun. I don't feel that it cleaned out my pores much or helped with my blackheads, but it did cut down the oil on my face and left it feeling refreshed. The mask is a little difficult to rinse off and you definitely have to watch and make sure you get everything rinsed down the drain. If you have little spots left in your sink that dry, they will take a little scrubbing to get off. Overall I really enjoy this mask and it does leave my face feeling refreshed, but if you have blackhead issues this wouldn't be the mask I would recommend."

I only apply it on my nose, chin and between my eyebrows since thats the black head and oily prone areas. I find that its best to apply this mask before a shower because it does leave behind soapy residue that can be hard to wash off. So i apply it before my shower and wash it off in the shower using the residue on the rest of my face. The first time i used it, it burned my face slightly (on a scale of 1-5, a 2) but after that it was fine. I'm really in love with this clay mask~"

This is my favorite face mask because it's fun and it does the job and isn't over priced. It's fun to do with your friends or just by yourself to relax. Also, when you smooth the bubbles out after it foams it leaves this cooling sensation that feels great on your skin! 10/10 would reccomend and going to buy this product again soon!"

Way better for your skin than a biore strip and more efficient too. Make sure to avoid leaving the jar exposed to air for too long, it will activate the mask. I usually spoon a bunch on my face, close the lid and then go back and smooth the mask on. A little goes a long way, it at least expands to twice it's size so be careful around your eyes and lips (although it doesn't burn, it's just annoying foam stuck in your eyelashes)."

I panicked and ran to the sink to remove it but it's HARD TO WASH OFF! The foam on top is easy to remove, but the gray paste stuck to your skin needs scrubbing to remove. Washed off what I could and then jumped in the shower. I like my showers comfortably warm (not scalding) and the warm water made my face feel like it was burning, even after the mask rinsed off. Returned to the mirror and my skin was red and blotchy and a little itchy. It took 2 days for my skin to look normal again. I obviously have a sensitivity to something in this product. The experience was pretty scary. I will never use another commercially prepared face mask again.

This mask, in combination with the Elizavecca Glutinous Snail Cream moisturizer, has made a very drastic difference in how my skin looks and feels. My acne is clearing up, the dried patches around the corners of my mouth and nose are clearing up, my skin has had a generally healthier glow, and it just leaves me with a general improvement of self confidence from putting effort in. I have oily skin and my boyfriend (who's also trying the mask with me tonight) has sensitive skin, and its been a very good experience for both of us.I would definitely recommend this mask, 10/10, any day of the week, for yourself or as a gift."

Not painfully so, and I had no redness after removing it, but definitely the kind that makes you have to stop yourself from scratching your face. The other issue I had was with removing the mask itself. Maybe I'm missing something, but it was SO hard to get this mask off. Maybe I'm not used to clay masks, but I felt like I really had to keep scraping it off my face. Still going to keep using it because my face felt great afterward, and I'm going to experiment with using less or more of the mask at one time."

As others have mentioned, I notice that the mask leaves a film behind on my face after washing it off. My face will feel tacky to the touch. I have to go back in with a face wash to remove the film.

She has normal skin so I was surprised to actually see it greasy. By then I had already ordered them so I gave them away as gifts with some bathroom sets and threw mine away.

Unfortunately it just didn't work for me. I've been using it for about a month now (every few days) and it does leave my skin feeling very soft but it hasn't done much to improve my skin. It is kind of hard to put on as well because it literally starts bubbling as soon as it touches your skin and then rinsing it off is even worse.

Even using the thinnest layer imaginable it still poofs quite a lot and is tons of fun, as well as effective. My skin loves this mask, and I will be ordering again when I run out and as gifts. This would make a GREAT starter mask for kiddos. It bubbles, causing tickling, but also a soothing sensation. It would be the talk of any little girl slumber party. More than that it really works. Clears out stubborn gunk, and preps the skin for the rest of your routine. I can use this when my skin is dry or oily to balance."

The mask comes with a small spatula which is convenient as it prevents contamination of the product and can easily scoop out the mask. I use this mask after I shower for about 10-15 minutes and then rub it in for another few minutes if I want a little extra cleansing. The consistency is \"slippery\" and you only need a little bit of it because it will start to bubble as it oxidizes. If you put too much you will have a face covered in gray foam. One thing I want to note is make sure you only put a small layer under your nose or you will end up breathing it in once it foams up (guilty of this). The scent is not to unpleasant but its no lemons and oranges either, however it didnt bother me too much. Removing the mask at its consistency can be difficult but I use a make up remover towelette to remove most of it, then start to rinse with warm water and it seems to do the trick. Make sure to remove it all around the hairline because you can breakout if product is left over (guilty of this as well). My skin is oily T-zone, sensitive, and acne prone and I found that my face felt really clean and tight afterward although my blackheads on my nose still remain so I can say that its super effective for that purpose. I use an aloe vera moisturizer after prior to going to bed and that works well to moisturize my skin to prevent dryness."
